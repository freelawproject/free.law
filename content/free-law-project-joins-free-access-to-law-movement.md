Free Law Project is proud to announce that it has been officially
accepted as a member of the [Free Access to Law
Movement](http://www.falm.info/). FALM is a consortium of non-profit
institutions dedicated to providing free and open access to the world's
law. Its members subscribe to the [Declaration on Free Access to
Law](http://www.falm.info/declaration/).

The Declaration explains in part that,

-   Public legal information from all countries and international
    institutions is part of the common heritage of humanity. Maximising
    access to this information promotes justice and the rule of law;
-   Public legal information is digital common property and should be  
    accessible to all on a non-profit basis and free of charge;
-   Organisations such as legal information institutes have the right to
    publish public legal information and the government bodies that
    create or control that information should provide access to it so
    that it can be published by other parties.

We have been operating consistently with the principles laid out in the
Declaration for some time. Finding ourselves in complete agreement with
the Declaration on Free Access to Law, we are excited now to make it
official and to formally join with our colleagues around the globe
engaged in these endeavors.

FALM members come from Africa, the Americas, Asia, Australia, and
Europe. Free Law Project looks forward to sharing ideas and knowledge
with this diverse group so that we can all better meet the challenges
facing free access to public legal information throughout the world.
