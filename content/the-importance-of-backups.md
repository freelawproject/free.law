At least since the destruction of the [Ancient Library of
Alexandria](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_alexandria), the world has
known the importance of having a backup. The
[RECAP](http://recapthelaw.org) archive of documents from PACER is a
partial backup of [documents taken offline by five federal
courts](https://www.pacer.gov/announcements/general/webpacer.html). It
is impossible to determine how complete a backup we have, because the
problem with missing documents is that you cannot even determine that
they are missing without a complete list of what used to be available.
No such lists exist for the documents from these five courts.

But as coverage of this surprising and unprecedented action by PACER
officials continues (*see*
[techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140826/18032328332/pacer-officials-give-weak-nonsensical-excuse-why-pacer-deleted-tons-public-court-records-with-no-notice.shtml)),
the BBC has an article that takes an interesting approach by pointing
out some of the [landmark civil rights cases taken off
PACER](http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-28953299) through this action.

The BBC mentions the case *Ricci v. DeStefano* which was decided at the
Second Circuit while  Sonia Sotomayor was a Circuit Judge. Sotomayor,
now a Supreme Court Justice, had her role in deciding the case closely
scrutinized during her Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Many who dug
in to Sotomayor's background during those hearings likely relied on the
documents available via PACER related to this and other cases she
decided. What will happen when the next individual from the Second,
Seventh, Eleventh, or Federal Circuit, is nominated for higher office?
Unless PACER officials make some accommodation, such as the one [we
asked for
yesterday](/2014/08/27/free-law-project-joins-request-for-access-to-offline-pacer-documents/),
researchers and the public will face the daunting task of requesting
these materials individually, possibly in person, at excessive expense
and inconvenience for everyone involved.

And as I told [Common
Dreams](http://commondreams.org/news/2014/08/28/decade-court-cases-quietly-wiped-online-database),
the Administrative Office of the Courts ("AOC") cannot argue that some
of these cases have been closed for "13 years." Some were closed this
year! They also cannot argue that "many had not been accessed in several
years" because as we demonstrated in [a recent
video](/2014/08/26/using-pacer-what-could-possibly-go-wrong/),
it can be very difficult and expensive to use PACER. Thus, PACER usage
statistics should tell us nothing about the importance of these files.
And often, as was the situation with Judge Sotomayor's historical
record, some cases only become particularly interesting years later and
for reasons possibly unrelated to the case itself.

Put another way, libraries should hang on to their copy of Plato's
*Crito*, even if its been a few years since anyone checked it out.

This PACER situation presses home more than ever the importance of
having a backup. Many critics of the PACER system were dissatisfied with
many aspects of the AOC's custodianship of America's judicial record,
but no critic ever thought that after so much work to move to online
electronic records, we would return to an offline system of access to
court records. If we now cannot even count on the courts to keep the
electronic records online, even if behind a byzantine paywall, then we
really must insist on a backup.
