Yesterday and today I've been in Ithaca, New York, participating in the
Law via the Internet Conference (LVI), where I've been learning tons!

I had the good fortune to have my proposal topic selected for [Track 4:
Application Development for Open Access and
Engagement](http://blog.law.cornell.edu/lvi2012/overview/track-4-application-development-for-open-access-and-engagement/).

In the interest of sharing, I've attached the latest version of my
slides to this Blog post, and the audio for the talk may eventually get
posted [on the LVI
site](http://blog.law.cornell.edu/lvi2012/presentation/wrangling-court-data-on-a-national-level/).
