Setting up a New Account (Skip Ahead if You Have One Already)
-------------------------------------------------------------

The process for setting up a PACER account is pretty quick and easy if
it goes smoothly. To set up an account, go to [the registration site and
create an
account](https://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/pscof/registration.jsf "PACER Registration -- bring it on!").
Most of the fields will be self-explanatory. At the bottom, if you're in
doubt, select "Individual" for your "User Type". On the second screen
you'll set up a user name, password, and security questions, and on the
third screen, you'll need to give payment information (this is required,
but won't be used).

If this all goes well, you should have a functioning PACER account at
this point. A few times we've seen that payment information fails the
verification process and then needs either human review or to be
reentered:

[![human-review]({filename}/images/human-review.png)If
you run into this problem, [log into
PACER](https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf) (ignore the
client code field), then go to [Account
Management](https://pacer.psc.uscourts.gov/pscof/manage/maint.jsf). From
there, you should be able to fix the problem, but sometimes this error
is shown due to duplicate account or other non-credit card errors. In
that case, call in to get your account working: (800) 676-6856. We
have  never had to wait 7-10 days to get an account working.

Install RECAP
-------------

If your account is working, the next step is to:

-   [Install RECAP for
    Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/recap/oiillickanjlaeghobeeknbddaonmjnc)
    or
-   [Install RECAP for
    Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/201452/recap-0.9.1-fx.xpi)

Either is fine.

Testing Things and Checking Your Balance
----------------------------------------

If your account is set up properly, you'll be able to [log into
PACER](https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csologin/login.jsf) (ignore the
client code field). When you do that, if RECAP is installed correctly,
you'll see a notification in your browser stating that "RECAP is
Activated" (if this is a Chrome browser you may need to look for a bell
icon). Great.

If you're using an existing account, before you begin, you should check
your remaining balance for the quarter. To do this, go to [the Billing
History
page](https://pacer.login.uscourts.gov/csobill-hist/billingmenu.jsf),
click on "This Quarter" and hit submit. PACER gives you $15 of free
downloads per quarter. If you exceed that amount by even a penny, you
pay the entire amount, so **check this amount carefully and always stay
below the $15 threshold**.

Drainage
--------

To drain PACER, we use [Operation
Asymptote](http://www.plainsite.org/asymptote/) to identify items to
download. Your process is:

1.  Go to [Operation Asymptote](http://www.plainsite.org/asymptote/)
2.  It will suggest an item for you to download. Click on the suggested
    link.
3.  You will be shown the cost of the item before you are charged. If it
    will push you above $15, **STOP**!
4.  If not, download the item by pressing the "View Document" link.
5.  The item will be downloaded to your computer and RECAP will upload
    it to the Internet Archive. Success! You've contributed to the
    public domain!
6.  Inform Operation Asymptote that the item was retrieved successfully.

Repeat that process until the next item would exceed the $15 quarterly
allotment, then **STOP**. If you exceed $15, you'll be required to pay
the whole amount. Be careful.

Once you've done all this, pat yourself on the back and enjoy the
remainder of your day. We'll see you again next quarter!

Problems?
---------

Send an email [using our contact
form](http://freelawproject.org/contact/).

Thank You
---------

Getting an account, providing your credit card number, and downloading
these documents is a lot of work. We're very grateful for your help and
we're hopeful that we can push the needle with this initiative. If
enough people use their quarterly allotment every quarter, we believe
PACER will notice. At the same time, you're helping to build the public
domain, and we're making the case that people want this content and are
willing to work for it.

Eventually, with enough effort, the PACER paywall ***will*** come down.
When that happens you'll be able to take pride in having played your
part of the process. Thank you for contributing to the public domain!

What Else?
----------

If you've spent your $15 and you still have energy to work on [the
PACER
problem](https://www.recapthelaw.org/2015/03/20/the-pacer-problem/),
there's more you can do:

-   You can look at our  [list of ways to
    help](http://freelawproject.org/2015/03/24/what-should-be-done-about-the-pacer-problem/).
-   You can help add features or resolve bugs in the RECAP extensions
    ([Chrome](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-chrome)/[Firefox](https://github.com/freelawproject/recap-firefox)).
-   You can recruit others to join this mailing list.
-   You can tweet about this, blog about this, or otherwise help to get
    the message out.
-   You can read and study [Public.Resource.Org's "Memo" on
    PACER](https://yo.yourhonor.org/) and get educated.
-   You can get in touch and ask us for something even more ambitious.
    We have lots of ideas for different types of people -- send us your
    info and let's talk.
-   You can suggest something else we haven't thought of.

So there's a lot you can do. It's a big problem, but we're going to
solve it together.
