On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an [Executive Order titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"][pdf]. The next day, civil rights and immigration lawyers began filing legal challenges throughout the country. As the dockets from these cases become available in Free Law Project's [RECAP Archive][recap], we are linking them on this page.

There appear to be many more cases than we have listed. [This search on our RECAP Archive][moar] turns up all cases with "Trump" in a party name that were filed on or after January 28, 2017. This is imperfect, but a start toward finding more cases.
