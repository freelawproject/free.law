On January 27, 2017, President Trump signed an [Executive Order titled "Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist
Entry Into the United States"](/pdf/EO-2017-02281.pdf). The next day, civil rights and immigration lawyers began filing legal challenges throughout the country. As the dockets from these cases become available in Free Law Project's [RECAP Archive](https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/), we are linking them on this page.

There appear to be many more cases than we have listed. [This search on our RECAP Archive](https://www.courtlistener.com/?type=r&filed_after=2017-01-28&order_by=score+desc&case_name=Trump) search turns up all cases with "Trump" in a party name that were filed on or after January 28, 2017. This is imperfect, but a start toward finding more cases.
