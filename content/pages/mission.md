purposes are primarily:**

-   to provide free, public, and permanent access to primary legal
    materials on the Internet for educational, charitable, and
    scientific purposes to the benefit of the general public and the
    public interest;
-   to develop, implement, and provide public access to technologies
    useful for legal research;
-   to create an open ecosystem for legal research and materials;
-   to support academic research on related technologies, corpora, and
    legal systems; and
-   to carry on other charitable activities associated with these
    purposes, including, but not limited to, publications, meetings,

**Current activities of Free Law Project are as follows:**

-   We seek to collect and freely distribute online all United States
    court opinions, both state and federal, both historical and current.
    Our collection of current opinions is accomplished through our
    [Juriscraper](https://github.com/freelawproject/juriscraper)
    project. Online distribution of the opinions occurs through our
    [CourtListener](https://courtlistener.com) project.
-   We develop technologies for use in legal research, such as a daily
    alerting service, advanced search capabilities, and a citator. These
    tools are deployed at [CourtListener](https://courtlistener.com).
-   We collaborate with others with similar goals and license all the
    software we develop under free software licenses. Source code is
    available for both
    [Juriscraper](https://github.com/freelawproject/juriscraper) and
    [CourtListener](https://github.com/freelawproject/courtlistener).
    Our [REST API](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/rest-info/) enables
    others to analyze or reuse on their own sites the materials we have
    collected.
-   We support academic research on [search
    technologies](http://citris-uc.org/research/projects/proactive_legal_information_retrieval_and_filtering)
    and provide [free bulk
    downloads](https://www.courtlistener.com/api/bulk-info/) of our
    entire corpus for use in academic research or for any other purpose.
-   We lead
    [workshops](http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~bcarver/juriscraper.html),
    present at
    [conferences](http://blog.law.cornell.edu/lvi2012/schedule/conference-program/),
    and hold other events to educate others about our work, how to get
    involved, and the underlying challenges facing the [free acces to
    law movement](http://www.fatlm.org/).
