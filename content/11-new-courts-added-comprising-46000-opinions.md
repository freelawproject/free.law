A goal of the Free Law Project is to make legal research easier and
faster. One way we do that is to scrape court websites, downloading any
opinions that they have, making them searchable and finding the
citations relationships among them. For many jurisdictions, we download
all the opinions they host, while at others we simply start downloading
their opinions on a given day and use those as fuel for our awareness
project whenever new material is published.

Today we are happy to share that thanks to several volunteer
contributors, we're adding a number of new jurisdictions to the project:

-   [Arkansas Supreme and Appellate
    Courts](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_ark=on&court_arkctapp=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)
-   [California Court of
    Appeals](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_calctapp=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)
-   [Illinois Supreme and Appellate
    Courts](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_ill=on&court_illappct=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)
-   [Tennessee Supreme, Appellate and Criminal
    Courts](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_tenn=on&court_tennctapp=on&court_tenncrimapp=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)
-   [Vermont Supreme
    Court](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_vt=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)
-   [Virginia Supreme and Appellate
    Courts](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_va=on&court_vactapp=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)

Combined, these new jurisdictions already add nearly [50,000 new
opinions](https://www.courtlistener.com/?q=&court_ark=on&court_arkctapp=on&court_calctapp=on&court_ill=on&court_illappct=on&court_tenn=on&court_tennctapp=on&court_tenncrimapp=on&court_vt=on&court_va=on&court_vactapp=on&stat_Precedential=on&stat_Non-Precedential=on&sort=dateFiled+desc)
to our collection, and as always, these are immediately available for
free via our [bulk downloads](https://www.courtlistener.com/dump-info/).
As these jurisdictions publish more opinions, we will have them
automatically, usually within 30 minutes from when they are posted.

We will continue adding more and more jurisdictions and opinions. This
is only the beginning.
