Fellow Board Member, Brian Carver, said, "Mike and I have been directing
Free Law Project for a while and when we thought about who we would most
like to help us with our mission, Tom Bruce and Jerry Goldman were our
top two choices. We're thrilled that these two, who have so much
experience in making legal materials available to the public online,
have agreed to help Free Law Project advance its public access mission."
