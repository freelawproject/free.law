The past week has been a busy one for us and we're excited to announce
that thanks to a generous data donation we've added an additional [7,000
oral arguments to
CourtListener](https://www.courtlistener.com/?order_by=dateArgued+desc&type=oa).
These files are available now and can already be searched, saved, and
made into podcasts.

Although 7,000 more oral arguments may not sound like much, I must point
out that these files are larger than your average MP3 and this has taken
a week for our powerful server to download and prepare. Our collection
now has more than 200 continuousÂ *days* of listeningÂ â€“ more than six
months of audio.

From here on, we'll continue getting the latest oral arguments from the
Federal Appeals courts that offer them but we are eager for more
donations so we can build up our archive. [Oyez.org](http://oyez.org) is
doing an incredible job with the Supreme Court (and we hope to integrate
these eventually), but if you know somebody in the federal appellate
courts or if you have a collection of oral arguments you'd like to
share, please [get in touch](https://www.courtlistener.com/contact/)!
We're eager to hear from you and to build the largest collection of oral
arguments that we can.
