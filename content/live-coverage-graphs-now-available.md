Thanks to a great volunteer contribution, we now have amazing graphs on
our coverage page instead of simply static numbers.

The old version used to simply say the number of total documents we had
for a court, leaving you scratching your head. The new version shows you
a timeline indicating how many documents we have in each court for each
year. It's a great improvement that brings a lot more transparency into
the coverage we have on the site.
