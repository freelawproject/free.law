In January of 2015, Carl Malamud of
[Public.Resource.Org](https://public.resource.org) posted a
[memorandum](https://yo.yourhonor.org/) detailing problems with the
federal [PACER](https://www.pacer.gov/) system that is supposed to
provide Public Access to Court Electronic Records and outlining a
three-pronged approach for addressing these problems this year.

More detail is available in the memorandum or in the video we made last
fall, "[Using PACER: What Could Possibly Go
Wrong?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA4Z9LEJSBw)"

However, this is the first of three shorter posts where we will try to
address:

-   What is the "PACER Problem"?

    PACER?](/2015/03/23/why-should-congress-care-about-pacer/)

These "various problems" with the PACER system include:

1.  **PACER fees are too high, especially in the case of surprise
    charges for searches where the total charge for the search is not
    known until after you have incurred the charge.** Using PACER's
    search functionality is terrifying. You have no way of knowing what
    you will be charged until after you have incurred the charge. In my
    own experience, slight typos have cost me upwards of $50. Imagine
    using Google and paying based on the number of results that Google
    returns, where the number of results that might be returned are
    completely unknown in advance. On the internet, you could use a
    different search engine, but PACER is an absolute monopoly, so some
    times you have no choice but to search and cross your fingers. A
    system designed only for the wealthy, who have the luxury of having
    no regard for what use of the system might cost them, is not a
    *public* access system.
2.  **The user interface is an inexplicable unusable disaster.** (See
    our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA4Z9LEJSBw) for
    numerous examples.)
3.  **There is no document-level search.** Unlike modern search engines
    that index documents and return responsive documents to queries,
    PACER users can only search for a litigant's name or by using an
    already-known case docket number. This makes the system utterly
    unusable for general purpose research. You cannot search for a
    general word or phrase, like "asylum" and hope to get back
    responsive documents. Instead one must already know the case one is
    looking for beforehand.
4.  **There is no accountability.** The [courts recently took thousands
    of documents
    offline](/2014/08/28/the-importance-of-backups/)
    and after a [public
    outcry](/2014/08/27/free-law-project-joins-request-for-access-to-offline-pacer-documents/)
    and [inquiring letters from members of
    Congress](/2014/09/16/senator-leahy-wants-pacer-documents-back-online/),
    the courts stated that they would put them all back online, but
    because no one but the courts has unhindered access to the system,
    no one can say what was taken offline and whether it was restored or
    not. As things stand now, fact-checking the courts on this is simply
    not possible.

So, again: **As a result of various problems with the PACER system, the
average member of the public has no meaningful access to federal court
records.**

There is no liberty without access to the law. The guarantees of the
First Amendment require that the public and the press have meaningful
access to court proceedings and documents. Having an open democratic
society requires that the people be able to scrutinize public
institutions to ensure their fairness, to enhance their quality, and to
safeguard their integrity. We cannot accept a justice system we are
prohibited from observing, because the watchful eyes of the public and
the press are what diminish injustice, incompetence, perjury, and fraud.
Meaningful public access is foundational to the functioning of good
government.

We will address in a subsequent post what should be done about the PACER
problem, but here we simply want to say: The PACER Problem is a problem
of consequence that cannot be permitted to stand.
