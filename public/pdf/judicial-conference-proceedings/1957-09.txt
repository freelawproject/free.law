      The Conference welcomed the new Chief Judge of the Ninth
    Circuit, Honorable Albert Lee Stephens, succeeding Chief Judge
    William Denman who retired on July 3, 1957. The Conference
    adopted the following resolution:
           This Conference learns with regret of the retirement of
        Chief Judge William Denman as a United States Circuit
        Judge in active service. As Judge Denman has been a valued
        member of this Conference for the past nine years, we shall
        miss his helpful advice and suggestions.
~                                          (1)
                                                                      ,
                                2


        Judge Denman entered on his duties as a United States
     Circuit Judge on March 11, 1935. He became Chief Judge
     of his circuit on August 12, 1948. The work of this Confer­
     ence at all times commanded his intense interest. We take
     note of his important contribution to the work of this Can . .
     ference. We recall his great energy and zeal in his efforts to
     adequately staff the Court of Appeals and the district courts
     in his circuit.
        We congratulate Judge Denman on his long and faithful
     service as a member of the federal judiciary. We express the
     hope that Judge Denman may enjoy good health and happi­
     ness for many years to come.
  The Conference also welcomed District Judge Phillip Forman
who was the first district judge to attend as a member of the
Conference under the Act of August 28, 1957, providing for the
membership on the Judicial Conference of the United States of a
district judge from each judicial circuit. No district judges from
the other circuits were in attendance as members of the.Confer­
ence, since none had been elected for such attendance under the
new law. However, District Judges Bolitha J. Laws (District of
Columbia Circuit), J. Joseph Smith (Second Circuit), Roszel C.
Thomsen (Fourth Circuit), Paul Jones (Sixth Circuit), Gunnar
H. Nordbye (Eighth Circuit) and Louis E. Goodman (Ninth
                                                                      o
Circuit) attended the sessions of the Conference, by invitation of
the Chief Justice and designation of their respective Chief Judges,
as members of a Committee on the Participation of the District
Judges in the Judicial Conference of the United States.
  The Conference sadly took note of the death on July 17, 1957
of the Honorable D. Lawrence Groner, and adopted the following
resolution:
        The Conference has heard with profound regret of the
     death of Chief Justice D. Lawrence Groner, who departed this
     life on July 17, 1957 after a lengthy illness and after having
     lived in retirement for a number of years since relinquishing
     the office of Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals of the
     District of Columbia which he had filled for many years
     with great distinction. Judge Groner served as United States
     District Judge for the Eastern District of Virginia from 1921
     to 1931 and made an outstanding record in that office as a
                                         3

              trial judge. He was appointed to the Court of Appeals of
              the District of Columbia in 1931 by President Hoover and
,.., 	        a few years later was appointed Chief Justice of that Court
              by President Roosevelt. It is largely through his efforts that
              the courts of the District of Columbia were given status as
              courts under Article III of the Constitution and not as mere
              statutory courts. He won recognition throughout the country
              as one of the ablest of our appellate judges. He took great
              interest in the work of this Conference serving on many of
              its most important committees and bringing to its discussion
              the ripe wisdom born of years of study and of judicial service.
              He was a man of sterling integrity, great industry, profound
              learning and sound common sense. He made a great con­
              tribution to the life of his times; and the members of this
              Conference with which he worked so long, so well and so
              faithfully are grieved that he is no longer with us.
            The Attorney General, Honorable Herbert Brownell, Jr., ac­
         companied by the Deputy Attorney General, William P. Rogers,
         and the Solicitor General, J. Lee Rankin, attended the morning
         session of the first day of the Conference.
,..,....    The Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations of the
*wi United States Senate, Honorable Carl Hayden, attended the
         morning session of the second day of the Conference and addressed
         the Conference briefly.
            Circuit Judges Orie L. Phillips, Albert B. Maris, and Alfred P.
         Murrah and District Judge Harry E. Watkins attended all or some
         of the sessions.
            Mr. William R. Foley, counsel of the Committee on .the
         Judiciary of the House of Representatives, attended the ses­
         sions of the Conference.
            William L. Ellis, Acting Director; Will Shafroth, Chief, Divi­
         sion of Procedural Studies and Statistics; Edwin L. Covey,
         Chief, Bankruptcy Division; and Louis J. Sharp, Chief, Proba­
         tion Division; and members of their respective staffs, all of the
         Administrative Office of the United States Courts, attended the
         sessions of the Conference.
                REPORT 	OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
        The Attorney General presented a report to the Conference;
      which appears in the appendix.
                                  4

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE 

    OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES COURTS
  Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. 604 (a) (3), the Acting Director had            t
previously submitted to the members of the Conference the
eighteenth annual report of the Administrative Office, covering
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1957. The Conference approved
the immediate release of the report for publication and authorized
the Acting Director to revise and supplement it in the final printed
edition to be issued later.
                 BUSINESS OF THE COURTS
   State of the dockets of the Federal courts-Courts of appeals.­
The number of cases filed in the courts of appeals in the fiscal
year 1957 continued t.he upward trend of the last 10 years by
increasing 3 percent over 1956, to reach a new high of 3,701. A
few less cases were terminated, 3,687, and pending cases increased
slightly to 2,043. Cases begun ill the Second, Fifth, and Sixth
Circuits increased between 15 and 20 percent and there was a
9 percent increase in cases filed in the Ninth Circuit. The number
of cases terminated exceeded the number filed in every circuit ex­
cept the Second, Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Circuits.
   The median time interval from filing of the complete record to
final disposition of cases terminated in the courts of appeals, after
                                                                          o
hearing or submission, in 1957 decreased slightly to 7.1 months
compared with 704 months in 1956 and 7.3 months in 1955. The
time interval for each circuit varied widely from a median of 3.8
months for the Fourth Circuit to lOA months for the Ninth Circuit.
which had the longest median, but which reduced that median more
than 3 months over 1956.
   District courts.-Generally the work load of the district courts in
the First t.o Tenth Circuits, inclusive, increased substantially in the
fiscal year 1957. This was particularly true in the difficult and
time-consuming private civil cases, which on the average take
much more of the time of the judge per case than do actions to
which the Unit.ed States is a party. Excluding the District of
Columbia (where there was a large decrease in civil cases filed be­
cause of a new statute giving the Municipal Court of the District
sole jurisdiction over domestic relations cases filed after its effec­
tive date), private civil cases filed in the district courts increased
3,400, or more than 10 percent over 1956, and private civil cases
pending were up 2,300. Civil cases commenced in all district courts
                                           5

decreased 14 cases to 62,380 compared with 62,394 in 1956. There
were 63,568 civil cases terminated, or almost 1,200 more than the
number filed, and pending civil cases decreased to 62,338.
   The median time interval from filing to disposition of civil cases
terminated in which a trial was held dipped for the first time in 5
years and was 14.2 months in 1957 compared with 15.4 months in
1956. Likewise the median time interval from issue to trial de­
creased from 10.3 months to 9.0 months. In 7 districts at least
half of the cases terminated after trial in 1957 were reached for
trial within 6 months of filing, which is the desirable goal fixed by
the Judicial Conference.
   The Southern District of New York, which reduced its pending
load of civil cases in 1956 by 2,129 cases, had a net addition to the
dockets of 364 cases in 1957, but made a further substantial reduc­
tion of its calendar of ready cases from 1,800 to 821.
   The criminal business of the district courts, excluding immi­
gration cases brought mainly in the 5 districts bordering on
Mexico, has remained relatively stable since 1948. There were
28,120 criminal cases begun in the fiscal year 1957 including 2,302
immigration cases, 27,929 cases were terminated, and at the end of
the fiscal year 7,495 cases remained, 20 per cent of which could not
be tried because defendants were not in custody.
   Bankruptcy cases begun went up sharply from 62,086 in 1956
to 73,761, the highest number on record of cases filed in a single
year. The increase over 1956 was 11,675 cases. 'While the cases
disposed of increased by 6,352 over the previous year to 64,666,
they were 9,095 short of the number filed and the pending caseload
climbed to 68,459. The increases in the last year were mainly in
straight bankruptcy proceedings involving wage-earning
employees.
           ADDITIONAL JUDGESHIPS RECOM:YIENDED
   The Conference discussed the state of the business of the courts
in the various circuits and in the Court of Claims and reviewed
the need for additional judicial assistance. After considering the
views of the respective Chief Judges and those of the C{)mmittees
on Judicial Statistics and Court Administration, the Conference
recommended the creation of one additional circuit judgeship for
the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and one additional dis­
trict judgeship for the Middle District of Tennessee with the proviso
that the first vacancy occurring thereafter should not be filled.

made (Conf. Rept. Apr., 1954, p. 2; Sept., 1956, p. 5), for the

          tention to the problem. The Committee was authorized to con­
          fer with the Attorney General concerning the facilities of his
          office for processing such cases and with any other persons who
          may be able to assist in expediting them.
             A proposal to create an additional judgeship on a temporary
          basis for the United States Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit,
          which is contained in S. 2799 as passed by the Senate on August 30,
          19.57, was referred to the Committees on Court Administration and
          Judicial Statistics for a report at the next session of the Conference.
              RULES OF       PRi\~TICE AND PROCEDURE FOR THE
                               UNITED STATES COURTS
            Chief Judge Biggs, Chairman of the Committee on Court Ad­
          ministration, and Circuit Judge Maris, Chairman of the Com­
          mittee 9n the Revision of the Laws, submitted to the Confer­
          ence a joint report of their respective Committees recommending
          legislation to the end that the Judicial Conference of the United
          States, acting with the approval of the Supreme Court, shall
.......   have the rule-making power now vested solely in the Supreme 

                                    8

Court with reference to criminal proceedings in the district courts
prior to verdict, criminal proceedings in the district courts after           ..
verdict and on appeal, civil actions in the district courts, admi­            •
ralty and maritime cases in the district courts, bankruptcy cases,
the review of decisions of The Tax Court of the United States
by the courts of appeals, and the trial of cases before United
State Commissioners and appeals therefrom; and that a stand­
ing committee of the Judicial Conference be appointed to carry
on this function with the assistance of a professional and clerical
staff in the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
   The Conference discussed the proposal at length and approved
the following draft of a bill:
   A BILL To empower the Judiciai Conference to study and recommend
     changes in and additions to the rules of practice and procedure in the
    federal courts

        Be it enacted by the Senate and House oj Representatives
     oj the United States oj America in Congress assembled, That
     section 331 of Title 28 of the United States Code, as amended,
     is further amended by inserting therein immediately after the
     fourth paragraph and before the fifth paragraph thereof an
     additional paragraph reading as follows:
        "The Conference shall also carry on a continuous study of
     the operation and effect of the general rules of practice and
     procedure now or hereafter in use as prescribed by the Su­
     preme Court for the other courts of the United States pursuant
     to law. Such changes in and additions to those rules as the
     Conference may deem desirable to promote simplicity in pro­
     cedure, fairness in administration, the just determination of
     litigation and the elimination of unjustifiable expense and
     delay shall be recommended by the Conference from time to
     time to the Supreme Court for its consideration and adoption,
     modification or rejection."
  The Conference referred to the Committees on Court Adminis­
tration and Revision of the Laws the problem of devising proce­
dures for the implementation of the proposal by the Conference.
Chief Judge Clark, who has had long experience with the rule­
making function, was made a member of both Committees to advise
and assist in this work.

    JOINT REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON SUPPORTING
      PERSONNEL AND THE COMMITTEE ON COURT AD~
      MINISTRATION
      Chief Judge Biggs, who is Chairman of the Committee on Sup~
    porting Personnel and also Chairman of the Committee on Court
    Administration, made a joint report for the two Committees.

                       UnUed States Comnl-issioners
      Chief Judge Biggs reported that two full-time United States
    Commissioners had appeared before the Committees and stated
    the view of the full-time commissioners that they should be placed
    upon a salary, rather than remain upon a fee basis. The Com­
    mittees have requested the Administrative Office to procure the
    necessary data so that the Committee on Supporting Personnel
    would have the required information for consideration at its next
    meeting.
                      &camination of Court Offices
        The Committees recommended that the Conference renew its
     recommendation (Conf. Rept. Mar., 1957, p. 5) that the function
~    of examining offices of the courts be carried on by the Administra­
~   	tive Office ruther than by the Department of Justice and that
     funds be included in the Budget of the Administrative Office for
     this purpose. The Conference approved the recommendation of
     the Committees.
                      Administrative Office Salaries
      At its September 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 18) the Judicial
    Conference renewed a recommendation that the salary of the
    Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts
    be placed at $22,500 a year and that the salary of the Assistant
    Director of the Administrative Office be increased to $20,000 a
    year. The Committees recommended to the Conference that it
    again renew these recommendations and that legislation be sought
    to this end at an appropriate time. The recommendation was
    approved by the Conference.
      The Committees informed the Conference that various steps had
    been taken to have the salaries of the heads of the four divisions of
    the Administrative Office fixed at grade GS-18 or $16,000, but that
                                  10 

all such efforts had proved unsuccessful. The Committees had
been informed that a further effort in this direction would be made
by the Acting Director who proposed to contact the officials of the
Civil Service Commission in the very near future. The Com­
mittees were of the view that if these efforts proved unsuccessful it
would be desirable to attempt, by appropriate legislation, to remove
the positions of the four division heads from the Classification Act.
The Committees accordingly recommended that in the event the
Acting Director failed to obtain favorable action from the Civil
Service Commission in respect to the reclassification of the four di­
vision heads, that the positions be removed from the Classification
Act by appropriate legislation to the end that their salaries may be
fixed by the Judicial Conference. The Conference approved the
recommendations of the Committees.
              Salary Increases for Federal Employees
   Upon the recommendation of the Committees, the Conference
approved the inclusion of the employees of the Judicial Branch in
any general salary increase bill applying to the personnel of the
Executive Branch of the Government which may hereafter be con­
sidered, and authorized the Director of the Administrative Office to     A
express this view to the Committees of the Congress when and as          V
it may be appropriate to do so.
                            Law Libraries
   Chief Judge Biggs reported that Circuit Judge Prettyman and
District Judge Goodman had submitted a report on libraries of
the Judiciary to the full Committees. The Committees decided
that further study should be given to the report by the Admin­
istrative Office, after which the matter would be further considered.
Appointment of an Additional Judge When em Incumbent Judge
                     Reaches Age 70
   The Conference at its l\farch 1957 session (Con£. Rept. p. 8)
directed the Committee on Court Administration to consider
further H. R. 3392, 85th Congress, authorizing the President to
appoint an additional judge when an incumbent judge reaches age
70, is eligible to retire and fails to do so, no vacancy to be created
when the judge who has reached age 70, dies, resigns, or retires.
The Committees had considered the bill but were not prepared to
make any recommendations. The Committee on Court Adminis­
tration was authorized to consider this proposal further.
                                      11 


             Creation of New Districts and New Divisions
      The Committees reported that there had been reported favor­
    ably by the Committee on the Judiciary and passed by the Senate
    on August 30, 1957, S. 2703, 85th Congress, which would divide
    the State of North Dakota into two judicial districts. The Com­
    mittees were of the view that such a division was unnecessary and
    contrary to the frequently expressed policy of the Judicial Con­
    ference that the creation of new districts is undesirable. (Conf.
    Rept. Mar. 1957, p. 9) The Conference was also informed that
    both the Judicial Council and the Judicial Conference of the
    Eighth Circuit were opposed to the bill. Upon recommendation
    of the Committees the Conference expressed its disapproval of
    S. 2703 and of any subsequent bill designed to effect the same end.
       The Conference thereupon renewed its recommendations that
    the bills to create a new district in the State of California, H. R. 229,
    H. R. 2523, H. R. 2532, H. R. 4827, and S. 604, and the bills to create
    a new division in the Northern District of California, S. 548 and
    H. J. Res. 189, all of which are pending in the 85th Congress, be
    disapproved. (See Conf. Rept. Mar. 1957, p. 9.) The Conference
    also expressed disapproval of S. 2840, combining both provisions in
    one bill, which passed the Senate on August 30,1957.
                    Diversity of Citizenship Jurisdiction
       The Committees reported that they had considered a report made
    by the Administrative Office respecting a number of cases in which
    jurisdiction was based upon diversity of citizenship and jurisdic~
    tional amount in relation to corporations qualified to do business in
    certain jurisdictions, and have requested the Administrative Office
    to explore the situation further, particularly in respect to suits
    brought in nonmetropolitan areas, Itl'ld to report at a future date.
    The Committees were authorized by the Conference to continue
    their studies and also to investigate cases in which a nonresident
    corporation is doing business in a State.
       The Conference was informed that there had been introduced in
    the 85th Congress a bill, H. R. 4497, which provides for increasing
    the jurisdictional amount in diversity of citizenship and federal
    question cases to $10,000 and for treating a corporation as a citizen
    not only of the State of its incorporation but also of the State in
    which it has its principal place of business. This bill carries out
-   precisely the recommendations heretofore made by the Conference
    in this regard (Conf. Rept. Mar. 1957, p. 9), and at the suggestion
    of the Committees the bill was approved by the Conference.

                                    12 


                       Classification of Law Clerks
       The Committees reported that communications had been re-            f
    ceived from a number of judges respecting the present classifica­
    tion of law clerks and that difficulties were being encountered in
    the Second Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and the Ninth Circuit in recruit­
    ing law clerks at the present salary levels. After fully considering
    data procured by the Administrative Office respecting the salary
    level of young lawyers employed in law offices of metropolitan
    areas and letters from deans of law schools in respect to salaries
    paid to law students immediately after graduation, the Commit­
    tees were of the view that some adjustment should be made in the
    salaries of law clerks and recommended that the present classifica­
    tion standards with respect to law clerks be amended by changing
    the respective grades of junior law clerk from GS-5 to GS-7, of
    assistant law clerk from GS-7 to GS-8 or GS-9 as the appointing
    judge may determine, and of associate law clerk from GS-9 to
    GS-lO, the salary grades for law clerk and senior law clerk to
    remain unchanged in grades GS-ll and GS-12, and the statements
    of qualification standards with respect to each of these grades of
    law clerk heretofore approved by the Conference to continue in
    effect. The Committees further recommended that the judiciary          ..
    budget for the fiscal year 1959 include sufficient funds to make       V
    effective the proposed classification as of July 1, 1958. The
    Conference approved the recommendations of the Committees.
       However, the Committees were of the view that the qualifica­
    tion standards for law clerks, which were approved many years ago
    and have continued in force with comparatively minor alterations,
    require review and may require general revision. The Adminis­
    trative Office has been requested by the Committees to make a
    study of these standards, as applied to the general grade of law
    clerks in the light of present employment practices by other Gov­
    ernment Departments. The Conference authorized the Commit­
    tees to continue the study and to consider possible revisions in the
    qualification standards for law clerks.
       In order to carry out the changes which were approved, the
    Conference recommended the revision of the Appropriation Act
    language to eliminate grade GS-5 from the grades of law clerks
    available for appointment by judges and to add grades GS-B
    and GS-lO.
                                            13
                Senior Law Cle1'k-Administrative Assistant
       There had been submitted to the Committees a proposal by
    Chief Judge Arthur F. Lederle of the United States District Court
    for the Eastern District of Michigan that chief judges of the
    circuits and chief judges of district courts of five or more judges
    be entitled to employ a senior law clerk-administrative assistant,
    at grade GS-14. After a full discussion by the Conference, the
    proposal was referred back to the Committees for further con­
    sideration.

          Q'ualifications of Chief Probation Officers and Clerks
       The Committees reported that the Federal Probation Officers
    Association had requested a change in the language of the qualifi­
    cation standards for chief probation officers of Grade GS-13, so as
    to include a chief probation officer in charge of an office with at
    least one other probation officer plus 3 years in grade GS-12, or
    6 years as a United States probation officer. The Association also
    requested the creation of a class of chief clerks in large probation
    offices at grade GS-7. The Committees recommended to the Con­
    ference that this matter be referred to the Administrative Office
    for further study and for a report thereon at the next meeting of
    the Committee on Supporting Personnel. The Conference ap­
    proved the recommendation.

                  Regional Coordinating Probation Officers
       The Committees further reported that the executive board of the
    Federal Probation Officers Association had requested the creation
    of five new positions in the Probation Division of the Administra­
    tive Office to provide regional supervision and coordination between
    Federal probation officers over the country. This proposal was also
    referred by the Conference to the Administrative Office for inves­
    tigation and report to the Committee on Supporting Personnel at
    its next meeting.
                         Salaries of Probation Clerks
      A letter addressed to the Chairman of the Committee on Sup­
    porting Personnel by the Chief Probation Officer of the United
    States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina
    respecting the classification of clerks in probation offices presently

Personnel.                                                                •

                 National Park Commissioners
   The study of the salaries of National Park Commissioners author­
ized by the Conference at its March 1957 session (Conf. Rept. p.ll)
had been previously submitted by the Administrative Office to the
Committees. Upon examination of this report, the Committees
were of the view that at the present time no further revision of
salaries of National Park Commissioners is necessary. However,
the Committees reported that if another Salary Increase Act is
enacted, it may well become necessary to again review salaries of
these Commissioners. The Conference approved the report of the
Committees.
                      Administrative Court Bill
    The Committees called to the attention of the Conference the
 bills, S. 2292 and H. R. 8751, 85th Congress, which embody a pro­
 posal approved by the American Bar Association for the creation
 of an Administrative Court under Article III of the Constitution
 of the United States to take over jurisdiction now exercised by the
Tax Court, the National Labor Relations Board in respect to un­           0. 

 fair labor practices, and by a number of other administrative agen­
 cies in the adjudication of certain specified unfair or unlawful prac­
 tices in trade and commerce, including the Interstate Commerce
 Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, the Civil
 Aeronautics Board, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Re­
serve Board, the Tariff Commission, the Federal Power Commis­
'sion and by the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agri­
 culture. No action was taken by the Conference on these bills.

           Review of Orders of Administrative Agencies
   The Committees reported that their Chairman, Chief Judge
Biggs, had appeared before the Committees of the Congress and
restated the view heretofore taken by the Conference and expressed
by the late Chief Judge Harold M. Stephens in respect to pending
<Ifood additive" bills, taking the position that judicial review of
proceedings in the Department of Agriculture in respect to food
additives should be conducted in accordance with the standards of
the Administrative Procedure Act and as presently provided by law.

                 Creation of an Eleventh Judicial Circuit
       The attention of the Conference was directed to H. R. 5677, and
    the amendment proposed to S. 420, 85th Congress, to provide for
    the creation of an eleventh judicial circuit to be comprised of
    Alaska, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington, and providing
    for the allotment of the circuit judges now in office in the Ninth
    Circuit between that Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit. The Con­
    ference was informed that both the Judicial Conference and the
    Judicial Council of the Ninth Circuit had previously opposed crea­
    tion of an additional or Eleventh Circuit. The proposed legisla­
    tion was thereupon disapproved by the Conference.

         Removal Jurisdiction in Diversity of Citizenship Cases
      There was referred to the Committee on Court Administration
    by the Administrative Office S. 1615, 85th Congress, to prohibit
    removal to United States district courts of actions commenced in
    State courts under State workmen's compensation laws. The
    United States district courts in Texas, Alabama, and New Mexico
    receive a substantial number of such cases by removal and the
    district courts of Louisiana receive some such cases. Upon the
    recommendation of the Committees, the Conference approved S.
    1615 as an appropriate limitation of the diversity jurisdiction.

                    Personnel of the Court of Claims
      The Committee on Supporting Personnel reported that the
    comparison of the grades and salaries of the supporting personnel
    of the Court of Claims with those of the supporting personnel of
    other United States courts having substantially similar duties,
    which had been authorized by the Conference (Con£. Rept. Mar.
    1957, p. 11) had not been completed. The disposition of this
    matter was, therefore, deferred until a report is received from the
    Administrative Office.
                            Judicial Vacations
      The Judicial Conference at its September 1956 session (Con£.
    Rept., p. 12) declared it to be the policy of the courts of the United
    States that in those circuits or districts in which the disposition of
    judicial business is not upon a current basis, judges' vacations
    should not exceed one month per annum. The attention of the

-   Conference was directed to the matter of compliance with this
                                16 

resolution by some courts and after a full discussion the matter was
continued until the March meeting of the Conference.                   f
Clerical Assistance for the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
  At its March 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p. 13), the Conference
referred to the Committee on Supporting Personnel the question
of what special clerical assistance may be necessary in the courts
of appeals for the handling of petitions in forma pauperis and re­
quests for the appointment of counsel following the decision of the
Supreme Court in the case of Johnson v. United States, 352 U. S.
565. A request for such assistance has been made by the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.
   The Committees were of the view that this is of importance, but
that it would be premature, in view of the comparatively short
experience, to recommend at this time payment by the United
States of individual counsel assigned for indigent persons seeking
to prosecute applications to appeal in forma pauperis, or to recom­
mend the appointment of an attorney on the clerk's office staff to
assist such persons. The Committees believed, however, that sub­
stantial relief will be afforded if the Conference authorizes the
appointment of an additional deputy clerk to assist the court in
connection with this litigation. Accordingly, the Committees
recommended to the Conference that the Acting Director of the
Administrative Office authorize the employment of an additional
deputy clerk at grade GS-ll for the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. The Conference approved the recommendation
of the Committees.

Representation in the District of Columbia of Indigent Persons
                     Alleged to be Insane
   The Committees brought to the attention of the Conference the
problem presented by the decision of the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in the case of Dooling
v. Overholser, Superintendent of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, which
held in substance that an insane person must be represented in
commitment proceedings either by a guardian ad litem, a next
friend, or an attorney~ and that such representation is required by
the District of Columbia Code. It was apparent to the Committees
that a substantial sum, approximately $50,000, would be required
to pay individual counsel assigned to represent such indigent
                                      17 

     defendants where a member of the family was not available to serve
     as guardian ad litem or as next friend.
        The Conference discussed the matter at length and recommended
     to the District Court for the District of Columbia three alterna­
     tives: (1) that money for this purpose be obtained through the
     District of Columbia Commissioners; (2) that money for this pur­
     pose be included in the judicial budget; or (3) that a change in the
     existing law respecting representation before the Mental Health
     Commission be requested of the Congress.

       Division of Clerks' Offices in the Administrative Office of the
                           United States Courts
       The Federal Court Clerks Association submitted to the Com­
     mittees on Court Administration and Supporting Personnel a res­
     olution proposing that a new division be created in the Adminis­
     trative Office of the United States Courts to be caned a Division
     of Clerks' Offices and that the chief of the division be a person
     who has had experience as a clerk of a United States court. At
     the suggestion of the Committees, the matter was referred to the
     Administrative Office for consideration and later report.

;;   Classification of Senior Courtroom Deputy Clerks in the Northern
                            District of California
        The classification of senior courtroom deputy clerks in the ~orth­
     ern District of California \yho are pr.esently graded at GS-7 was
     brought before the Committees by Judges Goodman and Mathes.
     The grades approved by the Conference for senior deputy clerks
     in multiple judge districts range from GS-7 to GS-g, and courtroom
     deputy clerks ill districts not using the master or central calendar
     system have been classified in grade GS-8. The Committees re­
     ported that if a satisfactory solution cannot be \yorked out, the
     Committee on Supporting Personnel would request a report by
     the Administrative Office concerning the classification of courtroom
     deputy clerks in master or central calendar distriets and report
     thereon to the Conference.

                        Secretaries and Law Clerks
       The Committees recommended to the Conference that it give
     specific approval to H. R. 3816, 8Dth Congress, providing for the
                                 18 

appointment of secretaries and law clerks by district judges, that
bill being in the precise form which was approved by the Con-           0
ference at its March 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 5). The bill
was approved by the Conference.
          Appointment and Compensation of Bailiffs
  The Committees recommended to the Conference that specific
approval be given to H. R. 3815, 85th Congress, transferring the
appointment of bailiffs from United States Marshals to United
States District Judges, the bill being in the precise form approved
by the Conference at its March 1955 session (Conf. Rept., p. 8).
The recommendation of the Committee was approved by the
Conference.
                   Salaries of Court Reporters
   The Committees informed the Conference that reports had been
received from district judges that difficulty is being encountered
in recruiting and retaining competent court reporters. It was the
opinion of the Committees that this has become a serious situa­
tion which threatens the efficient operation of many of the district
courts. Accordingly, the Committees recommended to the Con­
ference that the matter of reviewing the compensation of court          ¢
reporters be referred to an appropriate committee for a survey,
study and report. The Conference approved the recommenda­
tion of the Committees and referred the matter of the compensa­
tion of court reporters to the Committee on Supporting
Personnel.
                     COURT REPORTERS
   The Acting Director, Mr. Ellis, reported to the Conference that
a number of requests have been received from district judges that
the salaries of specific court reporters be increased. Upon the rec­
ommendation of the Administrative Office, the Conference author­
ized an increase in the salaries of the court reporter-secretaries in
the District of North Dakota from $5,915 per year to $6,450 per
year. The Acting Director informed the Conference that in view
of this action it may also be advisable to consider the comparable
position of the court reporter-secretary in the District of South Da­
kota. The Conference thereupon authorized similar action for the
court reporter-secretary in the District of South Dakota, if that be
found appropriate.
   The Conference concurred in a recommendation of the Adminis­
trative Office that, in view of the study just authorized, as above
                                          19 

        noted, no changes be made at the present time in the salaries of the
        court reporters in the Southern District of Florida, the Northern
.W' 	   district of Georgia, the Middle District of Georgia, the Western
        District of Texas, the Northern District of Iowa and the Dif'trict
        of Idaho.
        THE SALARY CLASSIFICATION OF THE SECRETARY TO
                    CIRCUIT JUDGE HEALY
          As directed by the Conference at its March 1957 session (Coni.
        Rept., p. 13) the Acting Director of the Administrative Office sub­
        mitted to the Conference under the provisions of the Judiciary Ap­
        propriations Act for 1958 the issue of the proper salary classification
        for the secretary to Circuit Judge Healy. The Appropriations Act
        now provides that the salary grades of secretaries and law clerks are
        to be fixed "as the appointing judge shall determine, subject to re­
        view by the Judicial Conference if requested by the Director, such
        determination by the judge otherwise to be final ...". In 1956,
        Judge Healy promoted his secretary from grade GS-8 to the posi­
        tion of secretary-law clerk at grade GS-ll, which action was op""
        posed by the Director on the ground that she has not been admitted
        to the bar, a requirement deemed essential in the standards adopted
        by the Judicial Conference.
           The Conference was of the opinion that the secretary to Judge
        Healy did not meet the qualifications of secretary-law clerk ap­
        proved by the Conference, and that the classification made by Judge
        Healy should not be sustained.
                     BANKRUPTCY ADMINISTRATION
          Circuit Judge Phillips, Chairman of the Committee on Bank­
        ruptcy Administration, reported that the Committee had met and
        considered the recommendations contained in the report of the
        Bankruptcy Division of the Administrative Office which was ap­
        proved by the Acting Director on August 16, 1957, relating to
        changes in salaries and arrangements and the filling of vacancies to
        occur by expiration of terms before the next meeting of the Judicial
        Conference.
           The report of August 16, 1957, was submitted by the Acting Di­ 

        rector to the members of the Judicial Conference and to the Judi­ 

        cial Councils and the district judges of the circuits and districts con­


--      cerned in accordance with the Bankruptcy Act. The Acting Di­ 

        rector's report together with the views expressed by the district 

        judges and the circuit councils was considered by the Committee. 

                                                       20 


The Conference had before it the Committee's report as well as the
recommendations of the Acting Director, the circuit councils .and
the district judges.

lating to changes in salaries and arrangements:

  , New position.

  All the above changes in salaries and arrangements were made
effective when appropriated funds are available.
  Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
took the following action with regard to changes in arrangements
and for the filling of vacancies in referee positions:
                                          FOURTH CIRCUIT
  Western District of Virginia.-Authorized the continuance of the position at
Roanoke on a full-time basis for a term of 6 years beginning February 5. 1958,
at the present salary of $12.500 a year; the regular place of office. territory and
places of holding court to remain as at present, without prejudice however. to
a readjustment in the present arrangements for the referee at Lynchburg and
the request of Chief Judge Paul for the restoration of a referee position at
Staunton. The Committee also recommended that a complete survey of the
                                             21 

    needs of the district be made by the Administrative Office for further considera­



-   tion by the Committee and the Judicial Conference at its meetlng in the apt· lug
    of 1958. This latter recommendation was approved by the Conference.

                                    FIFTH CIRCUIT
      Nen-thern Di:;tl"ict of Florida,-Authorized the continuance of the position at
    Tallahassee on a part-time basis for a term of 6 years, beginning January 24,
    1958, at a salary of $2,500 a year, the regular place of office, the territory and
    placeS' of holding court to remain as at present.

                                    SIXTH CIRCUIT
      Northern District of Ohio.
         (1) 	Transferred the Counties of Summit, Portage, Medina, Wayne, Holmes,
             Ashland, Richland, and Crawford from the territory now served by the
             Cleveland referees, to the territory to be served by the new referee at
             Akron.
         (2) 	Discontinued Akron and Bucyrus as places of holding court for the
             Cleveland referees, and deSignated them as places of holding court for
             the Akron referee.
                                   NINTH CIRCUIT
      Southern District of California,
         (1) 	Transferred Orange County from the territory served by the Los Angeles
             referees, to the territory served by the referee at San Bernardino.
         (2) 	Designated Santa Ana as an additional place of holding court for the
              referee at San Bernardino and discontinued it as a place of holding court
              for the Los Angeles referees.
         (3) 	Approved concurrent jurisdiction for the referees at San Bernardino
              Ilnd San Diego in San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange, San Dlego, and
              Imperial Counties.
      Di.itrict of Jdaho.-Authorized the continuance of the position at Boise on a

    referees at 'l'opelm and Wichita.
      District of Oklahoma.-Designated Ada and Ardmore as additional places of

      The Committee brought to the attention of the Conference the mutter of n
    differential in salaries in districts where concurrent jurisdiction is authol'izea
    for two full-time referees serving the same territory. After conSideration, til<'
    Conference requested the Bankruptcy Committee to study the questions of policy
    presented by the creatioll of such positions with a salary differential, and make
    a fnl'thH rt']wrt 10 the Hext meetin~ of the Conference.


       :;0011 O-ilS-H. Doc. 2!)7, 85-2--:\
                                22
                 Section 60 and Related Sections
   The Committee reported that it had considered the report of
its subcommittee relating to the proposed amendments of the
Bankruptcy Act as contained in H. R. 5787 and H. R. 5195. The
report of the subcommittee pointed out that H. R. 5195 in its
present form would have the effect of promoting statutory liens
on personal property not accompanied by possession to a position
ahead of costs of administration and wage claims. The full Com­
mittee was of the opinion that the present provisions of the Act
postponing such liens to the costs of administration and wages
should be retained, and recommended that H. R. 5195 be re­
drafted so as to preserye the position of costs of administration
as it exists under present la,,,, with a proviso that the postpone­
ment of such statutory liens should not thereby in any way affect
the standing, position, rank or seniority of valid contractual liens
on personal property. The Conference approved the Committee's
recommendation.
Submission Under the Phillips Plan of Proposal to Enlarge the
          Summary Jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court
  The Committee reported that the proposals to enlarge the5Junl­
mary jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court had been submitted
under the Phillips Plan and presented a summary of the letters
received regarding the action of the various circuit conferences,
councils and the views and opinions of certain circuit and district
judges. The Committee recommended approval of the proposals
and the enactment of legislation to enlarge the summary juris­
diction of tta Bankruptcy Court. The Conference voted to post­
pone action on the proposals until the March 1958 meeting of the
Judicial Conference.
              Supplemental Appropriations for 1958
   The Committee reported to the Conference that the number
of bankruptcy cases is continuing to increase rapidly and that a
volume of 85,000 cases is no,,, anticipated for the fiscal year 1958.
   Inasmuch as the changes in salaries of referees and for addi­
tional positions approved by the Judicial Conference at this meet­
ing were made effective at such time as appropriated funds are
available, and inasmuch as the present appropriations contain no
funds for the changes made at this time or to be made at the
Spring 1958 meeting of the Conference, the Committee recom­
                                            23 

           mended that the Director be authorized to seek an additional
           appropriation for referees' salaries for 1958 not to exceed $65,000.
_	         This estimate is based upon the assumption that supplemental
           funds will not be available before April 1, 1958. The Committee
           also recommended that the Director be authorized to seek an addi­
           tional appropriation not to exceed $75,000 for clerical help and
           impersonal expenses of the referees, necessary to handle the ex­
           pected volume of cases. The Conference approved these
           recommendations.
              Appropria.tions for 1959 for Referees' Salaries and Expenses
             The appropriations for referees' salaries and expenses for 1959
           are based upon an estimate of 95,000 cases. The estimated amount
           needed for referees' salaries is $2,051,300 and for referees' ex­
           penses, $2,636,600.
             The estimate for referees' salaries includes (1) the cost of salary
           changes and additional positions approved at the present meet­
           ing of the Judicial Conference for the full fiscal year 1959; (2) an
           estimate of the amount needed to cover the f'alary changes and
           new positions which may be expected to be authorized at the March
~      	   1958 meeting of the Conference for the full fh,cal year 1959; and
'.,I       (3) an estimate of the amount needed for additional salaries and
           positions which may be expected to be authorized by the Judicial
           Conference at its September 1958 meeting for three-fourths of
           the fiscal year 1959.
             Upon the recommendation of the Committee the above esti­
           mates were approved by the Conference.

           Amendments to the Bankruptcy Act Relating to the Combining
                               of Certain N otires
             The Committee reported the enactment of Public Law 85--275,
           which permits the 30-day notice of the last day fixed for the fil­
           ing of objections to the discharge to be combined with the lO-day
           notice of the first meeting of creditors. Section 58b (2) as now
           amended requires the notice of the last day fixed for the filing
           of objections to a discharge to be mailed to the trustee, if any.
           and his attorney, if any. If the 1\vo notices are combined amI
           mailed at the beginning of the proceeding it could not then be
           sent to the trustee as he v;;auld not have been appointed when
           the notice is mailed.
                                 24 


   General Order 16 of the Supreme Court now makes it the duty
of the referee to notify the trustee immediately of his appoint­
ment. The Committee recommended that the Judicial Confer­
ence suggest to the Supreme Court that General Order 16 be
amended so as to make it the duty of the referee also to notify
the trustee immediately upon his appointment of the last date for
the filing of objections to the bankrupt's discharge. The Con­
ference concurred in this recommendation.
   Determination of the Dischargeability of Provable Debts
   A bill, H. R. 106, pending before the 85th Congress, would give
jurisdiction to the Bankruptcy Court to determine the discharge­
ability or nondischargeability of provable debts. At its March,
1957 session, the Conference reaffirmed its approval of H. R. 106
with the suggestion that the language of Section 14c (3) of the
Bankruptcy Act to be removed by Section 3 of H. R. 106, be in­
serted in Section 17a of the Bankruptcy Act. This change would
have the effect of removing from Section 14c (3), as a ground
for a complete denial of a discharge, the obtaining of money or
property on credit by making or publishing a materially false
statement in writing respecting the financial condition of the
debtor and inserting similar language in Section 17a as a ground
for nondischargeability of a particular debt. (See Conf. Rept.,
Mar., 1957, p.18).
  H. R. 106 as so amended passed the House on July 15, 1957,
and is pending before the Senate judiciary Committee.
  The Committee recommended that the Conference reaffirm its
approval of H. R. 106 as passed by the House. The Conference
approved this recommendation.
          Study of Costs of Bankruptcy Administration
   The Committee reported that the Bankruptcy Division had
made complete cost studies for the fiscal year 1956 for 18 dis­
tricts and had brought them to the personal attention of the
referees, in conference in 13 districts. The studies were also
discussed with some or all of the district judges concerned in 4 dis­
tricts. Partial studies were made in 4 additional districts and
forwarded to the referees .
 . The Committee expressed the view that the cost studies have
been effective in reducing the costs of administration. It recom­
mended that the studies be continued covering the fiscal year           .(,
1957 and that they be brought to the attention of the referees in        ./
                                     25 

    districts where the costs of administration recurrently exceed the
    national average. The Conference concurred in these recommen­
    dations.
                          APPROPRIATIONS
        The estimates submitted by the Administrative Office pursuant
     to the statute (28 U. S. C. 605) for annual appropriations for the
    support of the courts for the fiscal year 1959 and supplemental ap­
     propriations for 1958 were approved subject to any changes which
     may be required by action taken by the Conference at this session.
        The supplemental estimates include funds for the payment of
     the salaries of judges resulting from the sharp rise last year in the
    number of retired judges, increased jury costs due to a moderate
     increase in the call for jury service and the increased allowances
    under Public Law 299 of the 85th Congress for mileage and sub­
     sistence allowances of grand and petit jurors, which were in­
    creased from seven cents to ten cents per mile and $5 to $7 per day
    respectively; increased fees payable to United States commis­
    sioners resulting from the enactment of Public Law 276 of the
    85th Congress and some increase in miscellaneous expenses as the
    result of the increased cost of printing records in cases appealed to
-   the Supreme Court in forma pauperis and of the increasing costs
    of law book continuations.
       The estimates for the annual appropriations for the operation
    of the courts during the fiscal year 1959 include increases for sala­
    ries and expenses of referees to process a larger volume of cases;
    funds for additional probation officers and staff to offset the nu­
    merical increase in the persons under supervision of probation
    officers and increased number of pre-sentence investigations since
    the recent expansion of the system was authorized by the Congress;
    provision for 25 additional deputy clerks to handle in part a rise in
    passport applications anticipated by the Passport Division of the
    Department of State; increases for travel and miscellaneous ex­
    penses for the additional personnel requested for 1959; increases
    in miscellaneous expenses on account of the higher costs of services,
    supplies and equipment needed by the courts in their normal opera­
    tions; and additional funds for the Administrative Office for addi­
    tional personneL An additional item of $75,000 for the removal
    of the remainder of the Administrative Office to rented quarters
    (except for the immediate office of the Director) not included in
    the preliminary estimates was approved by the Conference.
                                26
  On motion of Chief Judge Parker, the Conference authorized the
appointment of a Committee on the Budget and requested the Ad­
ministrative Office to send the budget estimates to the members of    t)
the Conference at least 2 weeks in advance of each session of the
Conference.
   THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CRIMINAL LAW
  Chief Judge Parker, Chairman of the Committee on the Ad­
ministration of the Criminal Law, reported that the Committee
had met and considered the various proposals for legislation re­
ferred to the Committee.
                 Appellate Review of Sentences
   Chief Judge Parker reported that the proposal for the review
of sentences in criminal cases by the courts of appeals con tained
in H. R. 270 of the 85th Congress had been circulated among the
judges under the "Phillips Plan", as authorized by the Confer­
ence at its September 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 33). The
large majority of the judges and judicial conferences responding
disapproved the proposal and the Committee likewise recom­
mended that the legislation be disapproved. The Conference ap­
proved the recommendation of the Committee.                           0
                      Definition of a Felony
   Chief Judge Parker reported that the Judicial Conference of
the Ninth Circuit was giving further consideration to its proposals
that "felony" be redefined and that the probation law be changed
to permit the dismissal of an indictment after the successful com­
pletion of a term of probation. These proposals were brought to
the attention of the Conference and referred to the Committee at
its September 1956 session (Conf. Rept., pp. 35, 36). The Com­
mittee recommended that action be deferred until the Ninth
Circuit has acted on these recommendations and that time be
allowed to give further consideration. The recommendation of
the Committee was approved by the Conference.
Proposal to Make the Federal Probation Act Applicable to the
    United States District Court for the District of Columbia
  Chief Judge Parker reported that a bill, H. R. 7261, introduced
in the 85th Congress. proposed to make the Federal Probation
Act applicable to the United States District Court for the District
                                     27 

     of Columbia. Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the


-
     Conference approved the bilL

        Office Expenses of the United States Commissioner in the
                           District of Columbia
        Chief Judge Parker reported that a bill, H. R. 268, had been
     introduced in the 85th Congress which would place the United
     States Commissioner for the District of Columbia in a position
     similar to certain United States Commissioners elsewhere with
     respect to the payment of actual and necessary office expenses,
     including the compensation of a necessary clerical assistant. Upon
     the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved
     the bill.

     Proposal to Enlarge the Jurisdiction of United States Commis­
                sioners in the Trial of Traffic Violations
        The Committee reported that a bill, H. R. 6251, pending before
     the 85th Congress, would increase the jurisdiction of United States
     Commissioners appointed by the United States District Court for
     the District of Maryland who try and sentence persons committing
     petty offenses on the Suitland and Baltimore-Washington Park­
     ways. In the case of traffic law misdemeanors, the jurisdiction
     of the Commissioners would be increased by the bill to authorize
     imposition of punishment not to exceed imprisonment for 1 year,
     or a fine of not more than $1,000, or both. The Administrative
     Office of the United States Courts would be authorized to furnish
     clerical help and supplies and to enter into agreements with other
     federal agencies or the State of Maryland for providing a court­
     room and temporary detention facilities. Upon the recommenda­
     tion of the Committee, the Conference approved the bill.
     Time Spent by Defendant8 in Confinement Prior to Sentencing
        By resolution presented to the Judicial Conference, the Na­
     tional Legal Aid Association has urged the giving of credit for
     time spent in jail prior to sentence for defendants sentenced to
     a term of imprisonment. An inquiry made by the Administrative
     Office at the request of the Committee disclosed that time spent
     in prison prior to sentencing is uniformly considered by district
     judges in imposing sentences. The Committee saw no need for
     legislation with regard to the matter and was of the opinion that
.>   such legislation might breed confusion and would not be in the
                                28

public interest. The statement of the Committee was approved
by the Conference.                                                    ,
         Appeals by the United States in Criminal Cases
   The Committee requested that the Conference renew its recom­
mendation that Section 3731 of Title 18, United States Code, be
amended so as to provide for an appeal by the United States from
an adverse decision on a motion to suppress evidence, and that the
pending bill,H. R. 263, be approved. (See Conf. Rept., Sept. 1956,
p. 35; March 1957, p. 22.) After a full discussion the Conference
rescinded its previous action and disapproved the proposed legis­
lation.
                          Habeas Corpus
  The Committee recommended that the Conference again ap­
prove the legislation heretofore endorsed by the Conference     in
respect to writs of habeas corpus by persons in custody pursuant
to a judgment of a state court, and to that end recommended that
the Conference approve the bills, S. 1011 and H: R. 8361, intro­
duced in the 85th Congress. The Conference adopted the recom­
mendation of the Committee.
Payment of Compensation to Counsel Appointed to Represent
              Poor Persons Accused of Crime
  The Judicial Conference at its September 1956 Session (Conf.
Rept., p. 34) renewed its .recommendation that legislation be en­
acted authorizing appointment of public defenders or the payment
of compensation to counsel appointed by the courts to represent
indigent defendants accused of crime. The Committee recom­
mended that Congress be urged to enact this legislation as em­
bodied in H. R. 108 of the 85th Congress. The Conference
approved the recommendation of the Committee.
Payment of Actual Expenses Incurred by Counsel Appointed to
               Represent Indigent Defendants
  The Committee recommended that pending the enactment of
legislation providing for a public defender Congress should make
provision for the payment of expenses actually incurred by counsel
appointed to represent indigent defendants, subject to the approval
of the district judge making the appointment, and that appropriate    .(
legislation to that end be drafted by the Administrative Office and       ~
                                     29 

    be submitted to Congress. The Conference approved the recom­
    mendation.

-                       Disparity of Sentences
      Chief Judge Parker informed the Conference that a subcom­
    mittee had submitted a report to the full Committee on the subject
    of disparity of sentences and the Committee recommends that
    further study be given to this matter by the subcommittee in con­
    nection with the Advisory Corrections Council and that further
    report be made with regard thereto. In the meanwhile, the Com­
    mittee recommended that the proposed legislation embodied in
    H. J. Res. 424, to establish institutes and joint councils on sen­
    tencing procedures; H. J. Res. 425, to authorize the court, in
    sentencing a prisoner, to fix an earlier date when the prisoner shall
    become eligible for parole; and H. R. 8923, to include under the
    Federal Youth Corrections Act persons under the age of 26 years
    at the time of conviction, be approved by the Conference. The
    Conference authorized a continuation of the study and approved
    the bills recommended by the Commi ttee.

                    PUn1:Shment for Contempt of Court
       Chief Judge Parker called to the attention of the Conference
    H. R. 3006, relating to trial and punishment for contempt of court
    with regard to which the advice of the Conference has been re­
    quested. The Conference granted to the Committee further time
    to give consideration to this matter.

                        JUDICIAL STATISTICS
       Chief Judge Charles E. Clark, Chairman of the Committee on
    Judicial Statistics, presented to the Conference a report of the
    activities of the Committee during the past year. The Committee
    had reviewed the work of the Administrative Office with reference
    to future trends in litigation authorized by the Conference at its
    September 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 36) and discussed the
    difficulties encountered in finding the causes for the great increase
    in civil litigation in the federal district courts. The Committee
    felt that a careful study by districts should be made and, there­
    fore, renewed its request for inclusion in the budget of the Admin­
    istrative Office provision for an additional attorney, secretary, and
    statistical clerk, as recommended last year but not approved by
    the House Appropriations Committee. The investigation to date
                                 30

shows that the most important dependable data available are the
judicial statistics of the various courts showing current activities
and justifying careful and circumspect projections of future trends.
The Committee stated that in view of the importance of the objec­
tive, it regarded this as a major task to be stressed.
   At the March 1957 session, the Judicial Conference approved the
resolution of the Committee on Court Administration providing
for quarterly inquiries to presiding judges in the Courts of Appeals
and the Court of Claims as to the pendency of cases under submis­
sion more than 3 months at the end of the quarter and not decided.
Thus far the Administrative Office has made requests for this in­
formation at the end of the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
1957, and the Committee reported that these reports show some
improvement over the conditions which existed at the end of the
second quarter. The Committee was of the opinion that the
inquiries were serving a useful purpose and so reported to the
Conference.
   The question of the issuance of monthly statistical reports con­
cerning the business of the Federal judiciary was considered by the
Committee, but it was not ready to make any recommendations
on the subject. The Committee has requested that a sample report
be furnished to it for study by the Administrative Office. However,
the Committee did recommend to the Conference that it consider
authorizing the issuance of short news relea.<:les at the end of each
quarter with reference to the quarterly reports of the Administra­
tive Office and that copies of the reports themselves, except details
with reference to specific cases under advisement by individual
judges, be made available to bench and bar alike. This would
have the advantage of calling to the attention of Congress and
to the public the general condition of the court dockets and the
condition of individual districts and would also be a method of
emphasizing the need for additional judgeships.
   Chief Judge Clark also announced the plan of the Committee
to undertake another time study, with the help of a number of
district judges, as to the time spent by them on various types of
eases. The Committee asked for the cooperation of the judges
from whom the Chairman will request this information, covering
a period of 3 months.
   Chief Judge Clark also called attention to the amount of infor­
mation on the business of the federal courts which is available by
reason of the method used by the clerks in reporting cases each
 month. This method, recommended by a Committee of the Na­
                                      31 

    tional Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement, was
    adopted by the Department of Justice in ·1935 and has been ex­
_   panded in usefulness since it was first taken over by the Adminis­
    trative Office. He reported that the Committee, therefore, urged
    use of the statistics by circuit judicial councils, State chief justices,
    court administrators and councils, and law schools of the country,
    .and that it will welcome requests and proposals to this end.
       The Conference directed that the report be received and that it
    be circulated throughout the judiciary for the information of the
     judges. Chief Judge Biggs, who has been working closely with
     the Committee on Judicial Statistics, was made a member of the
     Committee.
                         PRETRIAL PROCEDURE
       Judge Murrah, Chairman of the Committee on Pretrial Proce­
    dure, submitt.ed the report of the Committee to the Conference.
    He stated that the Committee had continued its activities during
    the year in promoting a wider and more effective use of pretrial
    procedure. In addition, he pointed out that the Committee had
    participated in the planning of the work of the study group ap­
    pointed by the Chief Justice to consider the special problems arising
    in the pretrial of long and complicated cases.
        He called attention to the resolution of the Conference at its
    September 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 15) that pretrial proce­
    dure should be used in every civil case before trial except in extraor­
    dinary cases where the district judge expressly enters an order
    otherwise, and to the resolution of the Judicial Conference of the
     Ninth Circuit to the same effect. He further stated that the re­
     ports made by the clerks of court to the Administrative Office indi­
     cate a steady increase in the extent to which the pretrial conference
     is being used to expedite the disposition of cases, define the issues
     and shorten trials, with settlements often resulting, and that the
     Committee was optimistic concerning the results which are being
     achieved.                               .
        Judge Murrah also related to the Conference the program organ­
     ized by the group of judges appointed to make a special study of
      the problems in the use of pretrial procedure in protracted cases
      which was held at the New York University School of Law in New
      York City during the last week in August on the invitation of the
      Institute of Judicial Administration. The seminar lasted for 5
      days and was attended by 30 judges. Judge Murrah stated that
      the participation of the bar in four of the sessions was particu­
                                  32 


larly helpful. He further reported that it was the general con­
sensus of those present that the seminar was eminently successful         .01( ..
in making available the experience and the views of judges and            .;
lawyers who have had extensive experience in the trial of pro­
tracted cases and that it was the intention of the Committee to
organize similar sessions in the future.
  The report of the Committee was received by the Conference
and the Administrative Office was authorized to circulate it among
the circuit and district judges.
            OPERATION OF THE JURY SYSTEM
   Judge Watkins, Chairman of the Committee on the Operation
of the Jury System, submitted the report of the Committee to the
Conference. He informed the Conference that three bills respect­
ing the operation of the jury system previously endorsed by the
Conference had become law. These provided for the use of certified
mail in summoning jurors, uniform qualifications for jurors serv­
ing in the Federal courts (which were approved as part of the Civil
Rights Act), and increases in the subsistence allowance of jurors
from $5 per day to $7 per day and in the mileage allowance from
7 cents to 10 cents per mile.

                          Jury Commission
  Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Conference
approved H. R. 3365, 85th Congress, to provide for a jury com­
mission for each United States district court, to regulate its com­
pensation, to prescribe its duties, and for other purposes. The
enactment of this legislation has been advocated by the Judicial
Conference since 1943. (See Conf. Rept., Sept. 1956, p. 3D.)

           Number of Peremptory Challenges of Jurors
   Judge ·Watkins reported that at the request of the COlillnittce
there was introduced in the 85th Congress, H. R. 3368, approved
by the Judicial Confr>rc:nce at its September 1956 session (Conf.
Rept., p. 39) which would permit the trial court ill its dist:l'etioll,
to allow multiple pl'aintiffs in civil actions additional peremptory
challenges just as is now authorized in the case of mUltiple defend­
ants. The bill passed the House of Representatives on April 15,
1957, and is now before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Upon
the recommendation of the Committee, the Conferellce reaffirmed
its approval of this legis1ation.
                                      33 

       Use of Special Counsel and Investigators by Grand Juries

-       The Conference was informed that a bill, H. R. 262, 85th Con­
     gress, had been introduced to permit grand juries in certain cases to
     appoint special counsel and investigators. This legislation is the
     same as that heretofore disapproved by the Conference. (Conf.
     Rept., Sept. 1952, p.16; Sept. 1953, p. 21; Sept. 1955, p. 24.) Upon
     recommendation of the Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its
     disapproval of this legislation.

                  Number of Jurors Required for Verdicts
        In September 1956 the Judicial Conference disapproved H. R.
     565, 84th Congress, which, in a civil action tried by a jury, other
     than one tried by a jury "as a matter of right guaranteed by the
     Seventh Amendment to the Constitution," would have provided
     that the number of jurors required to constitute the jury and the
     number who must agree for a valid verdict or finding should be
     determined by the law of the state in which the action is tried; or
     if there be no state law on the subject that the number of jurors
     shall be 12, and the verdict or finding shall be valid, if 10 of them
     agree. This legislation has again been introduced in the 85th Con­
     gress in H. R. 817 and H. R. 3428. Upon recommendation of the
     Committee, the Conference reaffirmed its disapproval of these bills.

                     Jury Trials in Condemnation Cases
       The Committee reported that there has been introduced in the
     House of Representatives another bill, H. R. 511, 85th Congress,
     to provide for jury trials in condemnation cases upon demand of
     any party, notwithstanding rule 71 A(h) of the Federal Rules of
     Civil Procedure. The Conference, on various occasions in the
     past, has disapproved this legislation (Con£. Rept., Sept. 1955, p
     25) and the Committee recommended that this new bill also be
     disapproved. The recommendation of the Committee was ap­
     proved by the Conference.
                           The Selection of Jurors
       Judge \Vatkins stated that for some years the Committee has
     considered bringing up to date the 1942 report of the Committee
     of the Judicial Conference on the Selection of Jurors, but has been
     unable to devise a plan therefor because of the lack of sufficient
3"   personnel in the Administrative Office. He said that during the
                                 34 


past year the matter has been discussed with the Institute of
Judicial Administration in New York, which functions under the
auspicr~s of the New York University School of Law, and that
the Institute has agreed informally that it will undertake the re­
search ·work necessary to bring the report up t{) date. He stated
that the Committee regards this as an important task and re­
quests the authority of the Judicial Conference to revise the report
and to officially request the Institute of Judicial Administration
to assist in the work. The request ,vas granted by the Confe!'E'r:rt~.
                      Costs of the Jury System
  A report prepared by the Administrative Office on the costs of
the operation of the jury system for the fiscal year ending June 30.
1957, similar to reports prepared for previous years, was submitted
to the Conference by the Committee. At the Committee's request,
the Conference authorized the report to be distributed among the
judges for their information to the end that jury costs may be kept
at the lowest level consistent with t.he efficient operation of the
system.
                     Handbook for Petit Jurors
   The Committee called to the attention of t.he Conference the de­
cision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Cir­
cuit in the case of United States v. Gordon, which held that the dis­
tribution of the Judicial Conference Handbook for Jurors in a crim­
inal case ,vas prejudicial and vitiated a convict.ion. The Com­
mittee reported that in the light of the criticism there expressed, it
authorized the Administrative Office to notify all the clerks of dis­
trict courts to withhold any further distribution of the handbook in
quest.ion until further notice. The Committee has been informed
that the United States has filed a petit.ion asking for a rehearing by
the court en bane, and that the defendant has filed a special plea
and answer thereto. The Committee gave to the Conference a brief
history of the handbook, but, since the matter is now pending in
court, deemed it improper to discuss the merits of its use.

        COMMITTEE ON REVISION OF THE LAWS
  Judge Maris, Chnirman, submitted the report of the Committee
on Revision of the Laws. Upon the recommendation of the Com­
mittee, the Conference approved the enactment of the following
                                 35 

bills, which contain proposals previously endorsed by the Confer­
ence:
   (1) Record on review of orders of administrative agencies.-H.
R. 6788, 85th Congress, except for minor corrective amendments,
is identical to S. 2223 and H. R. 6682 of the 84th Congress, which
the Judicial Conference approved at its September 1956 session.
 (Conf. Rept., p. 44).
   (2) Notice of applications for interlocutory relief from orders of
administrative agencies.-H. R. 6789, 85th Congress, is identical
with S. 2128 and H. R. 6631 of the 84th Congress, which were ap­
proved by the Judicial Conference at its September 1956 session.
 (Conf. Rept. p. 45).
   (3) Appeals from Interlocutory Orders of the District Courts.­
H. R. 6238, 85th Congress, is identical with H. R. 8331 of the 84th
Congress, which was approved by the Judicial Conference at its
September 1956 session. (Conf. Rept. p. 45).
   (4) Confinement with Probation.-H. R. 7260, 85th Congress,
is in the form which was approved by the Judicial Conference at
its September 1955 session. (Conf. Rept. p. 29).
   (5) Transfer of cases between the district courts and the Court
of Claims.-H. R. 3046, 85th Congress, is identical with H. R. 668
of the 84th Congress, which was approved by the Judicial Con­
ference at its March 1955 session. (Conf. Rept. p. 22.)
   The Committee reported as follows concerning legislation upon
which a report had been requested by the Conference:
   (1) Judicial review of deportation and exclusion orders.­
S. 345, 85th Congress, would provide an exclusive procedure for
judicial review of deportation and exclusion orders in lieu of the
Administrative Procedure Act. The Committee reported that the
purpose of the bill, as stated by its sponsor, is to eliminate the
delays in deportation caused by successive appeals, in various
forms, from deportation orders. This would be achieved by
providing a nonrepetitive exclusive procedure for review. \Vllile
the bill appeared to be unobjectionable from a constitutional
standpoint, the Committee was of the view that the judicial review
to be accorded deportation and exclusion orders is a matter of
Congressional concern. On this basis the Committee recom­
mended approval of the legislation provided that, by amendment,
the substantial evidence rule is made applicable to the review of
deportation and exclusion orders in habeas corpus proceedings
                                  36 


to the same extent the bill makes that rule applicable to proceed­
ings begun by petition for review. The recommendation of the
Committee was approved by the Conference.
   (2) Judicial review of decisions of the Administrator of Vet­
eran.'l Affairs.-H. R. 272, 85th Congress, would authorize a
review by the appropriate court of appeals of a final decision
of the Administrator of Veterans Affairs denying a claim of a
disabled veteran. Under the bill the findings of the Adminis­
trator as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, would
be conclusive. No judicial review of these final deeisions is pres­
ently provided. After a full discussion the Conference decided
to take no position on the policy of the bill providing judicial
review in these cases. However, the Conference recommended
that if the bill is passed the review should be in the appropriate
district court rather than in a court of appeals.
   (3) Amendment of Section 10 (d) of the Administrative Pro­
cedure Act.-H. R. 832, 85th Congress, ,'.'ou1d amend Section 10 (d)
of the Administrative Procedure Act to authorize reviewing
courts to postpone the effective date of agency action or to pre­
serve status or rights pending conclusion of review proceedings.
The Committee reported that it had received no information from
the proponents of the bill or elsewhere indicating the necessity for
expanding the jurisdiction of reviewing courts to the extent pro­
posed by the bill. In view of the broad scope of the bill and the
fact that no consideration appears to have been given to it by
the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives,
to which it was referred, the Committee suggested that no action
with respect to it be taken at this time. The Conference adopted
the suggestion of the Committee.
   (4) Venue in tort cases in the district in which the tort was
committed.-S. 1000, 85th Congress, would amend the venue stat­
ute to authorize suit on a tort claim in the district in which the tort
was committed. The Committee was of the view that the pro­
posal is not unreasonable insofar as it would broaden the present
venue statute so as to permit suit on a tort claim, not only in the
residence districts of the defendant and of the plaintiff, but also
in the district in which the tortious act took place. This would
be accomplished by adding a subdivision (e) to Section 1391 of
Title 28, United States Code. However, the bill proposes also to
add a subsection (f) which would seem to be intended to broaden
the venue statute so as to permit suit against any person or cor­
                                37 

poration in any judicial district which is the residence of a state
official who, by operation of state law rather than by actual ap­
pointment, becomes the agent of that person or corporation to
receive service of proce~s. The Committee was not prepared to
recommend such a broad extension of the venue statute and ac­
conlingly suggested that S. 1000 be approved with an amendment
striking out subsection (£). The bill with the suggested amend­
ment of the Committee was approved by the Conference.
   (5) Registration and enforcement of support ordeis in certain
state, territorial and other courts.-S. 183 and H. R. 285, 85th Con­
gress, as introduced, would authorize a support order made by
a court of one State to be registered in a State or Federal court in
another state to which the defaulting husband or father has re­
moved and the enforcement of such order by the court in which it
is registered. The bills also propose to make it a Federal criminal
offense for one liable under a support order to travel in interstate
commerce from the state in which the order was issued to any other
State or country to avoid compliance with the order. The Com­
mittee was convinced that there is need for some legislation in this
field, but that it is unnecessary and it would be unwise to provide
for the registration of support orders in, and their enforcement by,
the Federal district courts in view of the existence in every State
of courts with jurisdiction, procedure and personnel adequate for
the purpose, and in view of the widespread adoption by the states
of the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act. The
Conference disapproved the provisions of the bill which would pro­
vide for the registration and enforcement of such orders by the
Federal district courts and expressed no opinion on the other fea­
tures of the bill.
   (6) Registration in United States district courts of those por­
tions of divorce decrees of territorial courts of Alaska, the Virgin
Islands, Guam and the Canal Zone which provide for the pay­
ment of money or the transfer of property.-H. R. 819, 85th Con­
gress, is intended to meet the situation exemplified by Gitlin v.
Gitlin, 15 F. R. D. 458, which held that Section 1963 of Title 28,
United States Code, does not authorize the registration in a United
States district court of that portion of a divorce decree rendered
by the District Court of the Virgin Islands which provides for the
payment of money. The bill would amend Section 1963 so as
specifically to include the District Courts of Alaska, the Virgin
Islands, Guam and the Canal Zone among the courts to which
                                38 


Section 1963 applies, and it would also broaden that Section so as
to make it applicable to that portion of a divorce decree which pro­
vides for the payment of money or the transfer of property. The        !
Conference recommended that Section 1963 of Title 28, United
States Code, be amended to include the proposal contained in H. R.
819.
   Judge Maris reported that the Committee had considered the
following pending bills upon which reports had been requested by
Committees of Congress and which have been referred to the Com­
mittee by the Acting Director of the Administrative Office as au­
thorized by the Conference at its March 1957 session. (Conf.
Rept., p. 27.)
   (1) Standard of review in judicial review proceedinysunder the
laws governing financial institutions.--S. 1451, 85th Congress,
which has passed the Senate and is now pending in the Committee
on Banking and Currency of the House of Representatives, would
revise generally the Federal laws covering financial institutions.
Included in the bill are provisions for the judicial review by the
courts of appeals of various decisions of governmental agencies
in this field. The review proceedings are to follow the Administra­
tive Procedure Act except that the review is to be upon the weight
of the evidence. The bill thus departs from the standard of the
Administrative Procedure Act that agency findings shall be upheld
if supported by substantial evidence upon the record considered as
a whole. Judge Maris informed the Conference that the Commit­
tee on Banking and Currency of the House of Representatives has
requested the views of the Judicial Conference with respect to these
specific provisions relating to the standard of review. He further
reported that the Committee was unable from the information
secured to determine that there is a substantial distinction between
the proceedings which would be reviewed under this bill and the
many other types of agency proceedings which are presently re­
viewable under the substantial evidence standard of the Adminis­
trative Procedure Act. After a fun discussion, the Conference
directed that the Committee on Banking and Currency be informed
t,hat it is of the view that the standards of the Administrative
Procedure Act should be made applicable in full to the proceedings
reviewable under this bilL
   (2) Consolidation of parties in libel or slander actions in olle
district court.-H. R. 5601, 85th Congress, would amend sections
13!:H and 1404 of Title 28, United States Code, by adding a new
subdivision to each section. The Committee reported that it has
                                                                       -
                                     30 

     been unable to secure from the sponsor of the bill or from any
     other source a statement as to the basic purposes of the bill and
     exactly what is sought to be accomplished by it, and under the
     circumstances was unable to make a recommendation with re­
     spect to it. Due to the vagueness of the proposal, the Confer­
     ence voted to disapprove the bilL
        (3) Recording in State offices of notices of actions pending be­
     fore a United States district court with respect to real property.­
     H. R. 7306, 85th Congress, would amend Title 28, United States
     Code, by adding a new section 1964 which would require a notice
     of the institution of a suit in a Federal district court concerning
     real property by providing that the suit should not have the ef­
     fect of lis pendens unless it is registered, recorded, docketed ot'
     indexed as the State law provides if in fact the State law does
     provide for such registering, recording, docketing, or indexing
     of such Federal suits. The Committee reported that it believed
     that this bill would effect a desirable procedural improvement
     and that it should be approved. The Conference approved t.hp.
     bill.
        Judge Maris also reported that pursuant to the authority given
.-   by the Conference at its September 1956 session (Conf. Rept.,
     p. 46) the Committee had considered the following pending bills
     and proposals:
        (1) Judicial review of administrative findings of the Secre­
     tary of Labor.-S. 1629, H. R. 8214 and H. R. 8215 of the 85th
     Congress would provide for the judicial review of the adminis­
     trative findings of the Secretary of Labor under Title III of the
     Social Security Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act with
     respect to the compliance by a State in its plan of old age as­
     sistance or unemployment compensation with the standards of
     the Federal acts. These bills propose to give to a State, against
     which the Secretary has made adverse findings of compliance, a
     right of review of such findings by the court of appeals for the
     circuit in which the State is located, upon the record made before
     the Secretary, but with the provision that the court shall exer­
     cise its independent judgment without regard to the provisions
     of the Administrative Procedure Act. The bills were discussed
     by the Conference but no action was taken on them.
        (2) Judicial review of compensation orders under the Federal
     Employees Compensation Act.--B. 1653 and H. R. 6308, 85th
     Congress, would proviue for judicial review of the final·decisions
     of the Federal Employees Compensation Appeals Board in the
                                 40 

court of appeals for the circuit wherein the employee resides or
is employed, or in the Court of Appeals for the District of Colum-      l'
bia Circuit. In such proceedings the findings by the appeals
board, if supported by substantial evidence on the record con­
sidered as a whole, would be conclusive. The bills were discussed
by the Conference and passed over without action.
   (3) Review of orders of the Interstate Commerce Commis­
sion.-S. 1721 and H. R. 6085, 85th Congress, would amend sec­
tions 2322 and 2323 of Title 28, United States Code, so as to provide
that suits to review orders of the Interstate Commerce Commis­
sion shall be brought against the Commission as respondent rather
than against the United States. The Conference postponed action
on this proposal until the views of the Interstate Commerce Com­
mission and the Department of Justice with respect thereto could
be ascertained.
   (4) Divect review of judgments of the Supreme Court of Puerto
Rico by the Supreme Court of the United States.-H. R. 6009, 85th
Congress. would provide that judgments of the Supreme Court of
Puerto Rico shall hereafter be reviewed by the Supreme Court
of the United States on certiorari or appeal in the same way that
judgments of the supreme courts of the several States of the
Union are now reviewed by that Court, and that the jurisdiction
of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to review the judg­
                                                                        .-
                                                                         j



ments of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico be eliminated. The
Conference was informed that the volume of such cases now filed
in the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit is not large. Upon
recommendation of the Committee, the Conference approved the
bilL
   (5) Consent judgments and decrees by the Federal Trade Com­
mission and by the district courts in antitrust cases.-H. R. 427,
85th Congress, would amend section 4 of the Sherman Act so as
to provide that notice shall be published in the Federal Register of
any proposed consent judgment, decree or order before its entry
by a district court or the Federal Trade Commission in a proceed­
ing under the Antitrust Acts or the Federal Trade Commission
Act. It was the view of the Committee that the requirements
of this bill would provide an improvement in the procedure in
such cases which would be very salutary in that it would enable
the district court or the Federal Trade Commission, as the case
may be, to obtain the views of all persons who might be affected
by the proposed decree before it is finally formulated and en­
                                41

teredo Upon the recommendation of the Committee, the Con­
ference approved the bill.
   (6) Rules for the review and enforcement of orders of admin­
istrative agencies.-Judge Maris stated that the Honorable Wil­
lard W. Gatchell, General Counsel of the Federal Power Com­
mission, has proposed to the Committee two further amendments
to the uniform rule on the review and enforcement of orders of
administrative agencies recommended by the Conference in ac­
cordance with the provisions of the Hobbs Act and adopted by
nearly all the courts of appeals. The one proposal would require
that a notice of a petition for review be served upon all parties
who have been admitted to participate in the proceeding before
the agency and the other would limit the statement in the peti­
tion for review to that which is essential. The Committee be­
lieved that these proposals involve desirable improvements in the
uniform rule and accordingly suggested that the Conference rec­
ommend to the courts of appeals that they adopt the following
amendments to the uniform rule on the review and enforcement
of agency orders.
   The first paragraph of rule - - - , "Review or enforcement of
orders of administrative agencies, boards and commissions," is
amended­
  (1) by amending the first sentence thereof to read as follows:
      "A petition to enjoin, set aside, suspend, modify or other­
    wise review an order of an administrative agency, board or
    commission or officer shall be addressed to this court and shall
    contain a concise statement, in barest outline, of the nature of
    the proceedings as to which review is sought, the facts upon
    which venue is based, the grounds upon which relief is sought,
    and the relief prayed," and
  (2) by adding at the end of such first paragraph an additional
sentence reading as follows:
      "At or before the time of filing the petition the petitioner
    shall serve a copy thereof on all parties who have been ad­
    mitted to participate in the proceedings before the agency,
    board, commission or officer to which the petition relates and
    shall file with the clerk a list of those so served."
  The amendments to the uniform rule as proposed by the Com­
mittee were approved by the Conference.




                                                                       j
                                  42

       AIR CONDITIONING OF COURT QUARTERS
     Chief Judge Parker, Chairman of the Committee on Air Con­
ditioning of Court Quarters, reported that the Committee had car­
ried forward the program approved by the Conference and that
the objective of obtaining air conditioning in courtrooms and
judges' quarters where badly needed has, in large measure, been
attained. In view of the general program of air conditioning upon
which the General Services Administration has embarked and the
fact that Congress has indicated reluctance to grant preferential
treatment in this regard to supporting personnel of the courts, the
Committee recommended that the air conditioning program of the
Conference be discontinued and that the Committee be discharged.
   The Committee pointed out that as the building-wide program
of the General Services Administration progresses, air conditioning
units which have been installed under the Committee's program
will become available for use in the offices of court supporting per­
sonnel. The Committee, therefore, recommended that the Admin­
istrative Office be directed to install these units in the offices where
the need for them is greatest and seek the aid of the General Serv­
ices Administration in having them so installed.
   The Conference approved the final recommendations of the
Committee and expressed to the Chairman and the members
thereof its gratitude for the Committee's service.

      FEES OF UNITED STATES COMMISSIONERS
   The Conference was informed that its recommendation for legis­
lation to increase the fees of United States Commissioners, ap­
proved at the March 1956 session (Conf. Rept., p. 8), had passed
the Congress and was approved by the President on September 2,
1957, as Public Law 276 of the 85th Congress.

     QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROBATION OFFICERS
   The Conf~rence renewed its recommendation that appropriate
legislation be enacted to empower the Judicial Conference to pro­
mulgate minimum qualification standards which must be met by
all probation officers to be appointed in the future, and recom­
mended the enactment of H. R. 3817, 85th Congress, which is iden­
tical to the draft of a bill recommended by the Conference at its
March 1957 session (Conf. Rept., p. 10),
                                     43 

    UNIFORM RULES OF EVIDENCE FOR THE FEDERAL
                      COURTS
      The Judicial Conferences of the Third and Sixth Circuits have
    each recommended that a committee be created to study and rec­
    ommend uniform rules of evidence for the Federal courts. Judge
    Allen presented to the Conference the following formal resolution
    of the Judicial Conference of the Sixth Circnit, which was referred
    by the Conference to the Committee on Court Administration:
         BE IT RESOLVED, That the 18th Annual Conference of the
         Federal Judges of the Sixth Judicial Circuit (1) urges the
         Supreme Court to create a special advisory committee to study
         and recommend uniform rules of evidence for the federal
         courts, (2) urges all other federal judicial conferences to take
         similar steps, (3) urges the Attorney General to support the
         creation of such a committee and to indicate his willingness
         to cooperate with such a committee when established.
    RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE JUDICIAL CONFERENCE
              OF THE NINTH CIRCUIT

-      Chief Judge Stephens informed the Conference that the Judi­
    cial Conference of the Ninth Circuit at its Conference in June 1957
    had made the following recommendations. Those heretofore ap­
    proved by the Judicial Conference of the United States are as
    follows:
       (1) Approving pending legislation to make the Federal district
    courts of Puerto Rico and Hawaii constitutional courts and give
    judicial tenure during good behavior;
       (2) That the Second and Fourth Judicial Divisions of Alaska
    be consolidated and an extra judge be provided for Anchorage;
       (3) That the judge for Guam be appointed for a period of 8
    years, with salary on a parity with other district judges; and
       (4) That the Conference oppose pending legislation providing
    for appellate court review of sentences. (Acted on at this session,
    p. 26, supra.)
      The following resolutions of the Judicial Conference of the Ninth
    Circuit were referred by the Conference to the appropriate Com­
    mittees:
      (1) That jury commissioners be paid $25 per day, together with
    maintenance and travel pay the same as other court supporting
    personnel, but limited to 30 days in any calendar year;
                                 44
   (2) That court criers be upgraded to GS-6, with entering pay
of $4,008;
   (3) That district court clerks in cities with population of 300,000
or more be paid a salary of $15,000; in cities of 100,000 or more,
$12,000; all other districts $10,000.
SPECIAL SESSIONS OF THE DISTRICT COURTS IN A
             NATIONAL EMERGENCY
  At the March 1957 session of the Judicial Conference the Attor­
ney General emphasized the importance of insuring the availability
and use of existing civil authority in the event of a national emer­
gency (Appendix to Conf. Rept., p. 32) and suggested that the
judicial councils of the circuits may wish to issue appropriate
stand-by rules pursuant to section 141 of Title 28, enited States
Code. The Conference discussed the proposal, but made no rec­
ommendation concerning it.
THE CREATION OF TRIAL AND APPELLATE DIVISIONS
           IN THE COURT OF CLAIMS
  Judge Whitaker explained to the Conference the proposal con­
tained in H. R. 6954, 85th Congress, to authorize the Court of           ~
Claims by its rules to create trial and appellate divisions and within
the authority of existing law to prescribe the functions and duties
of each, the appellate division to be composed of judges appointed
pursuant to section 171 of Title 28, United States Code, and desig­
nated appellate judges, and the trial division to be composed of
commissioners appointed pursuant to section 792 (a) of Title 28,
United States Code, and designated trial judges. The proposal
was referred to the Committee on Court Administration for its
consideration and report at the next meeting of the Conference.

        JUDICIAL SURVIVORS ANNUITY SYSTEM
   The Administrative Office reported that, upon completion of the
first year of its operation, the Judicial Survivors Annuity System
is functioning smoothly and is in a satisfactory financial condition.
In addition to the contributions from the judges of 3 percent of
their salaries by payroll deduction, the fund will benefit in the
coming year from the contribution to be made by the Government
of an amount equal to that made by the member judges, provision
for which was obtained in the annual Appropriation Act for the
fiscal year 1958.
                                      45 

          Annuity payments totaling $228,684 have been made to widows
 -.. 	 during the fiscal year 1957 and on July 1, 1957, there were 116
-.-' 	 widows on the annuity payroll whose pensions aggregated slightly
       more than $252,000 annually. It was announced that the Admin­
       istrative Office would have an actuarial examination made of the
       Judicial Survivors Annuity Fund at the end of the current fiscal
       year and that the resulting findings and recommendations would
       be submitted to the Judicial Conference.

     PRETERMISSION OF TERMS OF THE COURTS OF
       APPEALS OF THE EIGHTH AND TENTH CIRCUITS
       At the request of Circuit Judge Johnsen, the Conference; pur­
     suant to 28 U. S. C. 48, consented that terms of the Court of
     Appeals of the Eighth Circuit at plac£s other than St. Louis be
     pretermitted during the current fiscal year.
       At the request of Chief Judge Bratton, the Conference consented
     that the terms of the Court of Appeals of the Tenth Circuit at
     places other than Denver be pretermitted during the current fiscal
     year.
                              COMMITTEES
       On motion of Chief Judge Biggs, the Conference renewed the
     authorization to the Chief Justice to take whatever action he may
     consider desirable with respect to increasing the membership of
     existing committees, the filling of committee vacancies and the
     appointment of new committees. Subject to such action all exist­
     ing committees were continued.
       The Conference declared a recess, subject to the call of the Chief
     Justice.

                                APPENDIX

        Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Judicial Conference:
        Once again it is my privilege and pleasure to render an annual
     report at this meeting of the United States Judicial Conference on
     matters of mutual concern which relate to the business of the
     federal courts. Through our cooperative efforts, we are making
     headway in unraveling common problems and in advancing the
     American tradition of equal justice under law.
        1. Case Backlog and Delay.
        As in the past, uppermost in the minds of members of the bench,
     the bar and the people is the difficult matter of cutting down the
     law's delays without impairment of constitutional rights.
        The Department of Justice has been trying to do its share in
     keeping litigation operations current. As of June 30, 1957, the
     drive which began on August 31, 1954, had reduced cases pending
     in United States Attorneys' offices by 31.07 percent or 10,503 cases.
     Criminal cases were reduced from 10,392 to 7,376 or 29 percent,
     while civil cases dropped from 23,413 to 15,926 or 31.98 percent.
     A number of United States Attorneys' offices are now current in
     their criminal and civil caseloads, and able to handle legal business
     in the courts without undue delay. These efforts have been re­
     flected by equal success in increasing collections of moneys due to
     the Government. Collections by United States Attorneys during
     the fiscal year ending June 30, 1957, amounted to $35,818,490, the
     second largest amount ever collected in a comparable fiscal year
     in the history of the Department.
        This is the result of an aU-out drive among the various divisions
     of the Department. Merely a few illustrations of what was done
     may be cited. We created a number of "task forces" composed of
     experienced attorneys from the Department who have been sent
     out to assist in those districts where the regular complement of
     lawyers was seriously overloaded with work. Thus, for example,
     a special team in the Tax Division was able to terminate 442 tax
     refund cases during a lO-month period, compared with 269 cases
     for the comparable period the year before. We created an Execu­
                                     (49)
                                 50 


tive Office of United States Attorneys which is analogous in many
respects to the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.
Through a special IBM reporting system, we were able to single
out for timelier action delinquent and other cases which would
otherwise get bogged down. In the Antitrust Division, an ac­
celerated program was carried out to dispose of cases by the use
of consent decrees. Efforts are now being made to cut downthe
burden' of the courts in protracted antitrust cases. We also elimi  w



l1ated the red tape which contributed to delays in disposition of
cases by greatly enlarging the discretion of the United States
Attorneys to settle thousands of matters without referral of them
to Washington for approval. We advised Federal judges of our
readiness to try cases in the summer months wherever the judgei"
believed such a program to be feasible. We improved the adminis­
 tration of the Immigration and Naturalization Service with a
 noticeable drop in the backlog of Government cases.
     This campaign by the Department to bring the Government's
 legal business to a current status could not have been accomplished
 without the splendid cooperation'by the Federal judiciary through­
 out the country. The increasing assignment of additional judges
 to districts where the problem of crowded dockets was most critical,
 setting up special terms for disposition of selected groups of cases,
 such as tax cases, the holding of court throughout the summer
 months, frequently in nonairconditioned court rooms, effective
 calendar control and extended use of pretrial techniques, are but
 typical of the many ways in which our Federal judges have re­
  sponded in the national drive 'to reduce unnecessary delay in
  litigation.
     But however great their efforts, it is clear that many additional
 Federal judgeships are still critically needed, not only to assist
 in the current drive to wipe out congestion and delay, but to fill
  the need of handling the ever-expanding business of .the courts
  caused by the continuing growth of our population and develop­
  ment of our economy. For example, there was an increase of
  11,675 bankruptcy cases filed in 1957 or 18.8% over 1956. Al­
  though satisfactory progress has been made, in some areas it still
  takes 21;2, 3 and even more than 3 years from issue for a civil case
  to be tried. The caseload per judgeship in civil cases is increasing
  and the need for the additional judgeships recommended by the
  Judicial Conference is most urgent. This congestion in litigation
  will not be eliminated until the new judgeships are created and
  all vacancies are filled.

-     2. The Attorney General's Conference on Court Congestion and,
    Delay in Litigation.
       You may remember that last year I reported on the initial
    results of a conference which I called in Washington of leaders
    of the bench and bar to discuss the problem of court congestion
    and delay in litigation, and to plan its solution. An Executive
    Committee was formed at the time composed of distinguished
    members of the Congress, the judiciary, and the bar. Its Chair­
    man has been Deputy Attorney General William P. Rogers. This
    Committee wasted no time in getting to work. Following various
    meetings, the Committee submitted its report in which it limited
    its recommendations to those proposals which would have an im­
    mediate and direct impact on the congestion and delay which exist
    in the courts.
       With respect to State courts, the Committee recommended the
    following:
       1. The establishment of centralized administrative supervision
    of all courts in a single head, preferably the chief judge of the
    state system, with authority to promulgate uniform court rules,
    and to assign judges to places where congestion is acute.
       2. The maintenance in all jurisdictions of uniform and up-to­
    date judicial statistics.
       3. The adoption of modernized rules of procedures such as pre­
    trial conferences and discovery procedures to promote the orderly
    and expeditious trial of cases.
       4. The adoption of businesslike methods for supervising court
    calendars so that the most efficient use could be made of the judge's
    time.
       5. Frequent conferences of members of the bar and judges to
    encourage cooperation in efficient judicial administration.
       Similar proposals were recommended for Federal courts in juris­
    dictions where they are not in effect. In addition, special recom­
    mendations were made concerning the Federal courts. These I
    shall discuss in a moment. At the same time, I shall indicate how
    the recommendations compare with those of the Judicial Con­
    ference and how they have been implemented as a result of unusual
    coordination among all branches of the Government and repre­
    sentatives of the bar and public.
      1. Chief Judges to relinquish administrative duties at seventy­
    five.

-     The Executive Committee on Court Congestion and Delay rec­
    ommended that 1egislation provide that the chief judge of a Federal
                                 52 

court of appeals or of a Federal district court shall relinquish his
administrative duties upon reaching the age of 70. In this pro-        .~
posal, the Committee gave recognition to the difficulty of the daily
administrative problems of the court, and concluded that senior
judges should not be called on to handle these onerous duties in
addition to normal duties.
  This recommendation followed a similar recommendation pre­
viously made by the Judicial Conference. Legislation was intro­
duced in the Senate and House to carry out the proposal, and
was supported by the Department. H. R. 985 was passed by the
House on May 23, 1957, with an amendment changing to 75 the
age at which a chief judge should be required to relinquish his
administrative duties. This bill and a related bill, S. 1339, are
pending with the Senate Judiciary Committee.
   2. Chief Justice to address Congress.
   Another recommendation of the Committee was that Congress
invite the Chief Justice of the United States to appear personally
before a joint session at the beginning of every Congress and
report on behalf of the Judicial Conference of the United States
on pending urgent requirements of the Federal courts and on
long-range programs to meet futUre needs before they become
critical. It was felt to be essential that the courts be represented
by a spokesman who directly and effectively could bring to the
attention of Congress proposals which would advance the proper
administration of justice.
   As you know, for several years the Department has been urging
the enactment of legislation authorizing the Chief Justice to ad­
dress a joint session of Congress either annually or at the begin­
ning of each session. The Department has given its support to
H. J. Res. 46 which provides for the Chief Justice to address
Congress annually.
   3. Additional judgeships.
   The Committee also recommended enactment by Congress to
 effectuate the recommendation of the Judicial Conference for the
 creation of 35 additional Federal district judgeships, 2 additional
 judgeships for the courts of appeal, and making permanent the
 4 temporary judgeships.
   Here again, marked progress has been made. Omnibus judge­
ship bills as well as numerous individual bills are pending with
 the respective Judiciary Committees. The Department has vig­
.orously supported creation of the additional judgeships before
                                       53 

   these C{)mrnittees. On August 30,1957, the Senate passed a num;­
_  ber of individual bills which would authorize the appointment of
-" additional judges for the Court of Appeals for the Second Cir­
   cuit, the Districts of Kansas, Maryland, Connecticut and Nevada,
   the Southern District of Mississippi, the Southern and Eastern
   Districts of New York, the Eastern, Middle and Western Districts
   of Tennessee, two in the Northern District of Illinois, one to serve
   all three Districts of North Carolina, Eastern, Middle and Western,
   one for the Southern District of Florida, two for the Eastern Dis~
   trict of Pennsylvania and one to serve both the Northern and
   Southern Districts of Iowa. In addition, the Senate passed a bill
   to make permanent the temporary judgeship in Utah, and to'
   create a temporary court of appeals judgeship for the Eighth
   Circuit.
      We must continue to enlist the aid of the Congress and the peo­
   ple in giving full support to recommendations for these and other
   judgeships so that the courts may effectively and expeditiously
   discharge their public responsibility.
          4. Roster of "Senior" judges.
          Consistent with the recommendations of the Judicial Confer­
 __    ence, the Committee also recommended amendment of section
,..;   371 (b) of title 28, United States Code, to designate as a "senior
       judte," rather than as "retired," a judge who takes advantage of
       the retirement provisions. It also recommended that provision
       be made for a "Roster of Senior Judges" who are willing and able
       to undertake special judicial duties upon assignment by the Chief
       Justice. This proposal would tend to mitigate the feelings of
       many judges that by retiring, they mark themselves unfit for pub­
       lic service even on a limited basis. The recommendation would
       make systematic provision for the utilization of the services of
       mature, experienced and respected senior judges who are willing
       and able to work. By keeping the assignment on a special basis,
       the judge will be protected from committing himself for more than
       he can effectively do as a public service. At the same time, the'
       Court is protected in event the judge should become ill or disabled~
          Identical bills to carry out this recommendation were introduced
       in the House and Senate, passed by both Houses and signed by
       the President.
         5. Expanded use of pretrial procedures.
         The final recommendation by the Committee dealing with Fed-·
-      eral courts was also in complete concurrence with another im­
                                  54 


portant resolution of the Judicial Conference. It provides that
pretrial procedures and techniques should be used in every civil
case in the Federal courts except in extraordinary cases where
the district judge expressly enters an order otherwise and finds
that the ends of justice would be better served without resort to
these procedures.
   The Committee recognized the early reluctance on the part of
many judges to employ novel procedures before their effectiveness
had been tested and established. But, as the Committee noted,
"the salutary experience with pretrial now justifies its adoption by
all district courts as a recognized means for providing better and
more expeditious trial of cases."
   The Committee also made recommendations of general applica­
bility which included a recommendation that law schools adopt
as part of their curriculum the teaching of methods and principles
to reduce delays and dilatory tactics; a recommendation that as a
guide in determining whether trial calendars are current, delay in
the final disposition of the average civil case beyond 6 months
after commencement of action be considered excessive; that deci­
sions on appeals be rendered within 6 months after entry of the
judgment appealed from; and finally a recommendation that more
publicity should be given to both the accomplishments and the
shortcomings of the judicial system.
   It is hoped that the Conference on Court Congestion and Delay
will continue its splendid work, and that it will now set its sights
on the long-range problems of an effective and adequate system
of justice in the Federal courts.
   There are a number of other matters of concern to the Judicial
Conference as to which time will permit only brief comment.
   Appointment of additional judges under certain circumstances.
   The Congress enacted legislation to provide that whenever a
judge appointed to hold office during good behavior becomes
eligible to retire for disability under Section 372 of title 28, United
States Code, and fails to do so, the President shall be authorized
to appoint an additional judge. As a condition of this appoint­
ment, a certificate of disability must be presented to the Presi­
dent by the members of the Judicial Council of the Circuit in
which the District or Circuit judge sits, and the President must
find that such judge is unable to discharge efficiently the duties
of his office and that appointment of an additional judge is neces­
sary (Public Law 85-261, approved September 2, 1957). In this
                                         55 

         event, the vacancy subsequently caused by the death, resignation
         or retirement of the disabled 'judge shall not befilled~
            The Judicial Conference recommended this bill. The Depart­
         ment went on record as favoring enactment of it.
            Habeaa Corpus; review by Federal courts of State court con­
         victions.
            At its March 1957 meeting, the Judicial Conference reaffirmed
         its earlier recommendation ·that legislation be· enacted to curtail
         abuse of the writ of habeas corpus by narrowing the area: in which
         applications can be made to lower Federal courts to review com­
         mitments tinder final decisions of State courts. Two ,bills, S. 1011
         and H. R. 8:361, to carry out these recommendations wer.epending
         with the respective Senate and House Judiciary Committees when
         the session ended.
            Public Defenders.
            At its March 1957 meeting the Judicial Conference renewed its
         earlier recommendation that legislation be enacted to provide
         PUblic defenders in the Federal courts or authorize payment of
         compensation to counsel appOinted by the Federal courts to. repre­
         sent indigent defendants. H. R. 108 would carry out this rec­
         ommendation. The Department has strongly favored this bill as
         well as H. R. 3791 which is different somewhat in text but identical
         in substance.
            Appeals by United States in Criminal Cases.
            The Department has transmitted proposed legislation to the
         Congress which would permit appeal by the Government from a
         judgment sustaining a motion to suppress evidence, even· though
         an indictment had been returned or an information filed. At
         present such a decision rendered after an indictment or informa~
         tion has been filed is regarded as an interlocutory one in the
         criminal action, from which no appeal lies on behalf of the Govern­
         ment. The bill would also authorize appeals by the United
         States from decisions dismissing prosecutions during trial upon
         defendant's motions raising issues of law. This pr.oposal intro­
         duced as H. R. 4753, is pending in the House Judiciary Committee.
            Bailiffs, appointment by courts.
            Under existing law (28 U. S. C. 755) bailiffs are appointed by
         the United States Marshal although by nature of their duties they
         are court attendants. H. R. 3815 would amend the present law so
,.....   as to provide for appointment of bailiffs by distriCt judges and
                                 56 

place them entirely under the supervision of the courts. Both
the Judicial Conference and the Department favor enactment              ""'"
of this measure.
    Administrative agencies, record on review.
    The House passed H. R. 6788, a laudable measure designed to
eliminate unnecessary expenditures of time and money in the
review of agency orders by the courts of appeals. This bill was
favored by the Judicial Conference and the Department. It would
authorize the courts of appeals to adopt, with the approval of the
Judicial Conference, rules prescribing the time and manner of
filing and contents of the record in all proceedings instituted
in the courts of appeals to review or enforce orders of administra­
tive agencies, when the applicable statute does not specifically
prescribe the time or manner of filing or the contents of the record.
This bill would also provide for abbreviation of such records pur­
suant to rules of court, stipulation of parties, or court order.
   Miscellaneous.
   There are several other matters which are the subject of pend­
ing legislation which may be of interest.
   H. R. 2516 and H. R. 4497 would increase from $3,000 to
$10,000 the amount necessary to give the district courts jurisdic­
tion of civil cases, including cases arising under the Constitution,
laws and treaties of the United States (28 U. S. C. 1331), and
cases involving diversity of citizenship (28 U. S. C. 1332). H. R.
4497 would also amend the law to provide that a corporation shall
be deemed a citizen of the State in which it has its principal
place of business as well as of the State of its incorporation. The
Judicial Conference and the Department favor this legislation.
   H. R. 4642 and S. 1890 would establish a Commission and Ad­
visory Committee on International Rules of Judicial Procedure.
The proposal would create an agency to study existing practices
of judicial assistance and cooperation between the United States
and foreign countries, and to make recommendation for the im­
provement of international practice and procedure in civil, crimi­
nal, admiralty, and quasi-judicial matters. This measure has
received widespread support by the Department, the American
Bar Association, and various local and international bar groups.
  Special Sessions during a national emergency.
   I cannot permit this occasion to pass without stressing once
again a recommendation made in my report to the March 1957
                                        57 

         Conference. This is to provide authority to permit special ses­
         sions of court anywhere within the district during a national
 .....". emergency.
          Uniform sentencing.
           Last year at this conference I discussed rather briefly with you
        problems created by disparities in sentences for similar crimes
        given to individuals with substantially the same background and
        prior record. Since that time we have given considerable atten­
        tion to this problem in the Department. We have held a number
        of staff meetings to consider alternative plans suggested from
        time to time for improving a situation which, as you know, has
        troubled a large number of Federal judges, as well as the Depart­
        ment.
           We have had the advice, among others, of Judge Burdette
        Daniel of California, who worked with the Chief Justice when
        he was Governor in drafting the statutes establishing the Cali­
        fornia sentencing plan and the establishment of the Adult and
        Youth Authorities of that State.. We have also studied the pro­
        posal of the American Law Institute that all felonies be grouped
        according to their seriousness and that the court be allowed to
        prescribe both an ordinlary sentence and an extended term for
...",   the habitual or dangerous offender.
           Various bills relating to sentencing procedures have been
        drafted and reviewed by a departmental staff group. Also, the
        Advisory Corrections Council, established by the Youth Correc­
        tions Act, has considered a number of proposals. Chief Judge
        John J. Parker and his conunittee on Punishment for Crime met
        with the Advisory Corrections Council, representatives of the
        Department, and myself to consider some suggested courses of
        action.
           Among the proposed bills we have had under advisement is
        one which would make it possible for the courts more widely to
        share their responsibility with the Executive Branch for deter­
        mining the amount of time a convicted offender should actually
        serve. This is accomplished by granting the courts discretionary
        authority to set a parole eligibility date at less than one-third
        the maximum sentence prescribed. The minimum sentence, how­
        ever, could in no case be more than one-third the maximum.
           Another bill embodying the principle of granting to the Execu­
        tive Branch a more important role in the sentencing process would
        extend the Youth Corrections Act to include those up to 26 years
                                58 

of age. Itt};!is weredone, the courts eouldapply the more flexible
principles. of that Act to a larger group. As many of you will
recall, the model Youth Corrections Act, as originally· drafted by
the American Law Institute, provided that it should be applied to
all offenders up, to 25 years of age who seem to have possibilities
of rehabilltation. The present Federal Youth Corrections Act,
which has worked so well, as recommended by the House and Sen:"
ate Committees on the Judiciary encompassed youth up to and
including age 23. The age limits, however, were reduced on the
floor of the Senate on the suggestion of one of the Senators who
thought it wise to proceed more slowly and offered an amendment,
which was adopted, to include only those who had not passed their
22nd birth date. Now that we have had so satisfactory an ex­
perience with t.he Act, it may be possible to extend it to a larger
group.
   Another proposal is based on the assumption that an inter­
change of points of view between the various United States Judges
would help to establish more generally accepted standards and
policies of sentencing. 'fheproposed bill would authorize the
Judicial Conference to sponsor a series of institutes and joint
councils for this purpose. These discussions would have as their
objective the formulation of principles and criteria for sentencing
that would assist in promoting equal administration of the criminal
laws oHhe Uriited States.
   The bills embodying these proposals have been forwarded by
the Advisory Corrections Council to Congressman Emanuel Celler,
Chairman of the lIouse Committee on the Judiciary,and Senator
Thomas Hennings, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Na­
tional Penitentiaries, for their consideration. Congressman Celler
introduced them in the House on July 31, and I understand they
have been, transIT)itted for study and comment to the Judicial Con­
ference, to the Federal judges, to law school deans, teachers of
criminal la.w, and a number of others who have given attention to
this proposal. The Congressman has also invited other suggestions
his committee might consider next year.
   The Department has not yet reached a final conclusion as to the
position we should take with regard to these bills.
   Federal Youth Corrections Act.
   In October 1956 District Courts west of the Mississippi River
were authorized to invoke provisions of the Youth Corrections
Act. Thus, nearly 6 years after this Act was approved by the
                                 59 

Congress, it became available to all the Judicial Districts within
the territorial limits of the United States. Implementation of this
program for the Western States posed numerous problems for the
Director, Bureau of Prisons. The continued high level of popular.
tion in all Federal institutions made it difficult to certify the avail·
ability of special facilities for persons committed under its provi,..
sions. Because of his keen interest in and understanding of the
problems of youthful offenders, however, the Director took emer­
gency measures to provide space and adequate staff at the Federal
Correctional Institution, Englewood, Colo. In addition, the Bu­
reau has taken steps to convert the Federal Prison Camp at Tucson,
Ariz., from a facility used largely for Immigration Act violators to
a center for the treatment and training of selected juvenile and
youth offenders. The staffs at both Englewood and Tucson have
been augmented with specialists, particularly interested and skilled
in helping young delinquents.
    Since the Act was implemented for the Courts east of the Mis­
sissippi River in January 1954, more than 1,500 youths under the
age of 22 have been committed to our custody under its various
pro\·isions. During 1956, 387 youths were committed to us as
youth offenders; in 1957 this number rose to 627. It is apparent
that the Courts are availing themselves of the Act and we can
expect an increasing number of youths in this age group to come
to us for treatment and training under its provisions. Seventy­
 three of the 88 Judicial Districts in the "C"nited States have in­
 voked the treatment and training provisions of the Act. In the
short period between October 1956, when first available to judicial
 districts west of the Mississippi, to June 1957, 25 judicial dis­
 tricts out of a total of 33 had committed youths under the Act.
 To date, the Courts have committed some 135 young men for 60
 days study and observation, at the conclusion of which a full
 report and recommendation is given the committing Judge. In
 these reports every effort is made to provide a full and compre­
 hensive view of the offender's background, capabilities, mental
 attitudes and character traits. We are encouraged and pleased
 by the comments of the Judges who have availed themselves of
 these diagnostic services.
    We regret that the current session of the Congress did not
 appropriate funds to begin construction of the Western Youth
 Guidance Center, which is so urgently needed. With funds appro­
 priated for 1957, preliminary plans were drawn and the Site Selec­
                               60 

tion Committee reviewed a number of proposals submitted by
communities in the area tentatively selected for this facility. We   "t,
are convinced that the continued increase in the use of the Youth    J
Act by the Courts will impress upon the Congress the need for an
additional institutIOn for these offenders, and we expect to make
our needs known when the Congress convenes again next year.
   Rehabilitation of these youthful offenders requires the co­
ordinated efforts of several agencies. The Probation Service, the
Youth Division of the Board of Parole, and the Bureau of Prisons
all are striving to improve their techniques in working with these
persons. It is most encouraging to report that of about 600 youths
authorized for release to June 30 only 125 had violated the condi­
tions of their release.




                                                                     l
