<p className="lead">Installing the RECAP Extension on Microsoft Edge is easy and only takes a few seconds, just follow the steps below. <strong>Heads up</strong>: Edge may show a warning after install, scroll down if you see it.</p>

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <PurpleButton
    size="lg"
    href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/ckkpjgceaenndjdjpbaoaociikjpfdjg"
    extraClasses="inline-flex md:px-4 sm:text-md md:py-2"
  ><DownloadIcon className="flex-shrink-0 h-4 w-4" aria-hidden="true"/>&nbsp;Add to Edge</PurpleButton>
</div>

When you click the button, you will be directed to the Edge Add-ons site. Once there, simply click "Get":

</div>

Then click "Add Extension":

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Image width="450" height="263" src="/images/edge/install.png"/>
</div>

And that's it, you've installed RECAP! ðŸŽ‰

However, Edge may automatically turn the extension off, and you may see a warning like this:

<div className="flex justify-center">
  <Image width="300" height="261" alt="Screenshot of Edge warning" src="/images/edge/warning.png" />
</div>

## Why does Edge disable RECAP?

If you see this warning, do not worry: <a href="https://github.com/freelawproject/recap/issues/396#issuecomment-3024752068">it's incorrect</a>.
What happens is the extension introduces the RECAP Archive to the browser, which Edge mistakenly interprets as the extension changing the default search engine.
This is <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/MicrosoftEdge-Extensions/issues/324">a known issue</a> and is why the browser flags the extension and requires you to re-enable it manually.

Don't let a mistaken warning stop you from enjoying the benefits of using our extension, as well as contributing to the public good!
Rest assured, you can safely re-enable it.

## How do I re-enable RECAP?

1. Click "Turn on" or go to <code>edge://extensions</code>.
