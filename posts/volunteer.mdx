<p className="lead">We appreciate your interest in volunteering to support our work! There are a few ways to contribute your time.</p>

## As a User

If you use CourtListener, then your feedback is invaluable. Please [let us know][c] what bugs you and what you love. 


## As a Software Developer

All of our code is open source and we have more work than we can ever complete.

If you know Django, Tailwind, ElasticSearch,  AWS, or other technologies in our stack, we'd love your help fixing bugs or building new features. [Get in touch][c], and note your skills and time availability. If you have a recent résumé, include it. When we get your email, we'll try to think of a project that'd be right for you.

We also maintain a project board for volunteer developers, where you can sometimes just grab something to work on.

## As a Journalist

You probably know what to do: Use our links and tell people about our initiatives.

Beyond this, we hope you'll use and evangelize [RECAP](/recap/) and [our alerts system](https://www.courtlistener.com/help/alerts/). Some news organizations pay for alert subscriptions. Maybe you know the decision-maker at your organization?


## As a Librarian

We need help getting the next generation of users. Library Guides help! If you can write guides about our materials and put them on your library's website, that really helps get the word out. We maintain [a page for librarians](https://free.law/librarians/) that can help make libguides. Let us know if you have questions while developing any kind of material.

Our data goes deep. We regularly need help gathering research or data.  We have a #librarians channel in our Slack workspace where we hope you'll hang out. Get in touch to get started.


## As an Attorney

If you are an attorney that works in federal court, we encourage you to use [@recap.email](https://www.courtlistener.com/help/recap/email/) so all of your cases are automatically available to the public. If you prefer, it can be done [somewhat anonymously](https://www.courtlistener.com/help/recap/email/#whats-the-best-way-to-simply-contribute-to-the%C2%A0cause).

If you work at a firm that is  for committed to shaping the future of legal practice, supporting access to justice, and leading in legal technology, you might push for your firm to join the [Justice Partner's Circle][jpc].

Beyond this, if you're using our system, we hope you'll give us your feedback. The legal space is endlessly complicated, but we can often make changes to address newly identified corner cases or issues.
