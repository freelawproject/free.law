Then just write markdown. You can learn more about it [here][markdown-help].

### Adding an image

The syntax for adding an image is:

```
<CaptionedImage
  imgProps={{
    "src": "/images/zapier/flow-1.png",
    "alt": "A screenshot of the first flow on Zapier.com",
  }}
  href="/some-link-to-somewhere/"
  border="border border-gray-400"
>A screenshot of the first flow on Zapier.com.</CaptionedImage>
```

Or:

```
<div className="left-image or right-image">
    <img src="/images/recap_r-150x150.png"
         alt="RECAP Logo"/>
</div>
```

Images should always be scaled to at most 688px wide. Any more than that will just make them bigger and slower to download. 

After an image is merged, there's a bot that comes around eventually and optimizes it to make it download even faster.


### Centering buttons and other things

You can use the `centered-row` class to include multiple elements in a row:

```
<p className="centered-row">
  <PurpleButton href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/webhooks/" size="lg">Learn More</PurpleButton>
  <PurpleButton href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/webhooks/getting-started/" size="lg">Get Started</PurpleButton>
</p>
```

### Embedding YouTube videos

For example, easily embed YouTube videos using a standard link like this:

<YouTubeVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdfuLlcL1CU"/>

**Please note**: To ensure the video looks good in any screen size, always use `<YouTubeVideo ... />` instead of the code provided by YouTube in **Share > Embed**.

If you need the video to start at a given time, you will need to use the URL provided by YouTube's embed feature,
but instead of copying the full `<iframe ...` code snippet, simply copy the full URL that comes after `src=`

```
<p className="centered-row">
  <img src="/images/example/youtube-embed-link.png"
       alt="Screenshot of embed link"
       className="w-96"/>
</p>
```

The video now starts at 00:42

<YouTubeVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NdfuLlcL1CU?si=ybZWg1Bce_W34IXo&amp;start=42"/>


### Embedding other content

```
<ResponsiveIFrame
  className="h-[560px] w-full"
  src="https://www.courtlistener.com/visualizations/scotus-mapper/962/embed/?dos=2&type=spaeth&xaxis=time"
></ResponsiveIFrame>
```

**Pro tip**: You can tweak the height by changing `h-[560px]` to whatever value you need.
Likewise, `w-full` makes it span the entire width, but you can change this to `w-[100px]` or any other value to resize the embedded content.


### Do a sidebar (beta)

Try something like this:

```
<RightInfoBox border={true}>
  <h3 className="mt-2 mb-2">How It Works</h3>
  <p className="my-0">An encoder machine learning model, fine-tuned for information retrieval, represents legal opinions as embeddings (high-dimensional numbers) that capture their semantic meaning. When you submit a query, the same model translates it into embeddings, and an approximate nearest neighbor algorithm identifies opinions with the most semantically similar meanings.</p>
  <p className="my-0">For a detailed comparison of keyword versus semantic search, check out our help page on [Citegeist][cg].</p>
  <PurpleButton href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/search/#semantic-search">Try It Now</PurpleButton>
</RightInfoBox>
```

### Adding a collapsible disclosure widget

Use `<SimpleDisclosure>` to create an expandable/collapsible section with a button:

```
<SimpleDisclosure buttonText={"Click to learn more"}>
  <p>This is hidden content that expands when the user clicks the button.</p>
  <p>You can include multiple paragraphs or any other content here.</p>
</SimpleDisclosure>
```

This creates a collapsible section that the user can expand by clicking the button. Useful for FAQs or additional context that doesn't need to be visible by default.

### Need more?

Some useful bits can be found in `widgets.js`, `layout.js` or `buttons.js` to spruce up your posts.
