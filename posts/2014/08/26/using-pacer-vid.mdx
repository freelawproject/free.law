If you only watch one video about using the federal Public Access to
Court Electronic Records (PACER) system, make it this video by Free Law
Project's Brian Carver: "Using PACER: What Could Possibly Go Wrong?"

<YouTubeVideo src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hoBhYxxycuk"></YouTubeVideo>

The video provides a demonstration of what a regular member of the
public might experience trying to find a copy of a recent newsworthy
federal district court opinion on the court's website and through the
federal PACER system. This example was genuinely chosen because Brian
himself had heard about a recent newsworthy case out of the District
Court for the District of Maryland. In fact, we're fairly sure that
other examples might cast these sites in an even worse light.

Free Law Project believes that Congress should provide adequate funding
to the federal courts so that the financial argument for PACER's fees
would be moot and everyone could agree that public access to court
records should be free. But even in the absence of that, we conclude
from this demonstration that the non-document related fees in PACER for
search results and reports that are charged without an interstitial
warning of their magnitude are particularly onerous and should be
abolished. The courts could take this step immediately, while continuing
to charge for actual court documents by the page, and a major obstacle
to public access would be removed. Of course the video demo also
illustrates a number of usability concerns that we think are best
resolved by allowing third parties, such as Free Law Project, to build
better search and access tools on top of these documents, but this is
only feasible if at least these third parties are given free or very low
cost bulk access to the underlying documents. We hope the Administrative
Office of the Courts will be open to such options.

We recommend watching the video Full Screen and/or in High Definition so
that the slides are readable.
