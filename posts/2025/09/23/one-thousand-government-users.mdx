<p className="lead">This summer, CourtListener reached several major milestones. In this first post of our three-part series, we’re highlighting adoption across government.</p>

CourtListener now has **1,000 verified users with .gov email addresses**.

Because the .gov domain is reserved for federal, state, local, and tribal government entities, this milestone reflects a wide and meaningful adoption of CourtListener across the public sector.

For us, it’s a strong signal of trust. Judges, clerks, staff attorneys, and administrators are using CourtListener every day to access case law and court records. As open legal infrastructure becomes part of daily government workflows, the value of accessible and reliable data becomes even clearer.

We’re grateful for the growing community of government professionals who make CourtListener part of their work.
