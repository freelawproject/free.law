<p className="lead">This summer, CourtListener reached several major milestones. In this second post of our three-part series, we’re highlighting the growth of our public audience.</p>

Earlier this summer, CourtListener welcomed **over 1 million unique visitors in a single week**—a first for the site.

This audience is broad: lawyers, journalists, academics, public interest advocates, and self-represented litigants all come to CourtListener to find case law and court records they can’t easily access elsewhere.

Crossing the one-million mark is a reminder that the need for open, reliable legal information is not limited to specialists. It’s something the public at large relies on, whether for research, reporting, advocacy, or navigating the legal system.

We’re proud to provide this resource at scale, and grateful to everyone who turns to CourtListener as their source for free legal information.

Thank you to our infrastructure team that keeps everything humming!
