<p className="lead">This summer, CourtListener reached several major milestones. In this final post of our three-part series, we’re highlighting the adoption of our v4 API.</p>

Since its launch last fall, the CourtListener API has already processed **over 100 million requests**.

Developers and organizations across the country are using the API to build new tools and services—everything from research platforms to analytics dashboards to civic technology projects. The scale of adoption demonstrates the real-world demand for structured, reliable, and open court data.

For Free Law Project, this milestone is an affirmation that open infrastructure can power innovation well beyond our own platform. By making legal data accessible, we enable others to create new tools, expand research, and improve access to justice.

We look forward to continuing to strengthen the API as we support the many developers and organizations building on top of it.
