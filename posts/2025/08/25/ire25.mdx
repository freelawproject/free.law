<p className="lead">Alongside journalists and legal experts, William shared how Free Law Project’s tools help reporters, researchers, and the public overcome barriers to court transparency.</p>

## Why This Matters:

Court transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, but access is often complicated by outdated systems, high fees, and inconsistent practices across jurisdictions. William highlighted how Free Law Project works to address these challenges by:
- <a className="font-bold" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/">CourtListener:</a> Our free legal research platform with millions of opinions, docket alerts, and advanced search features.
- <a className="font-bold" href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/">RECAP Archive:</a> The largest open collection of federal court filings—crowdsourced from PACER and freely available to the public.
- <span className="font-bold text-black">New Tools:</span> <a href="https://free.law/2025/06/18/recap-search-alerts-for-pacer/">Search Alerts</a>, <a href="https://free.law/2025/07/31/oral-argument-transcripts/">Oral Argument transcripts</a>, <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/rest/">APIs</a>, and <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/help/api/webhooks/getting-started/">webhooks</a> that make it easier than ever to follow cases and investigate issues.

By making the law accessible to everyone—not just those with deep pockets—we’re helping journalists shine a light on the courts and keep the public informed.
