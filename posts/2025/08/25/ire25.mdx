<p className="lead">Alongside journalists and legal experts, William shared how Free Law Project’s tools help reporters, researchers, and the public overcome barriers to court transparency.</p>

## Why This Matters:

Court transparency is a cornerstone of democracy, but access is often complicated by outdated systems, high fees, and inconsistent practices across jurisdictions. William highlighted how Free Law Project works to address these challenges by:
- [**CourtListener:**][courtlistener] Our free legal research platform with millions of opinions, docket alerts, and advanced search features.
- [**RECAP Archive:**][recap] The largest open collection of federal court filings—crowdsourced from PACER and freely available to the public.
- **New Tools:** [Search Alerts][alerts], [Oral Argument transcripts][oa-transcripts], [APIs][apis], and [webhooks][webhooks] that make it easier than ever to follow cases and investigate issues.

By making the law accessible to everyone—not just those with deep pockets—we’re helping journalists shine a light on the courts and keep the public informed.
