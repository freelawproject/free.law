<p className="lead">Oakland, CA (December 2, 2025)—Free Law Project today announced that it has been selected as a winner of the [2025 Amazon Web Services (AWS) Imagine Grant](https://aws.amazon.com/government-education/nonprofits/aws-imagine-grant-program/), a public grant opportunity open to registered charities in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, United States, and Canada and registered 501(c) nonprofit organizations in the United States who are using technology to solve the world's most pressing challenges.</p>

The grant will support Free Law Project's Litigant Portal and its new Justice Initiatives division. Free Law Project's Litigant Portal aims to give people without lawyers clear, personalized legal guidance, court-ready documents, and direct access to court systems—using secure, AI-powered technology to make the justice system easier to navigate and more equitable for everyone.

Free Law Project was named a winner in the **Go Further, Faster** category which recognizes highly innovative projects using advanced cloud services. Free Law Project will receive $150,000 in unrestricted funding, $15,000 in AWS Credits, and engagement with AWS technical specialists. Awardees were selected based on several factors including the innovative and unique nature of the project, impact on mission-critical goals, and clearly defined outcomes and milestones.

Built on AWS' cloud infrastructure, the Litigant Portal combines generative AI with Free Law Project's trusted legal data to deliver accurate, jurisdiction-specific guidance at scale. The platform uses Amazon Bedrock to power an intelligent, multi-agent system that retrieves authoritative legal information, explains it in plain language, provides tailored action plans, helps users complete court forms, and validates outputs through human-in-the-loop review.

Free Law Project's Executive Director, Michael Lissner said, "Justice shouldn't depend on whether you can afford a lawyer. With the support of AWS, Free Law Project is using technology to level the playing field, making the legal system clearer, fairer, and more accessible for everyone."

"At AWS, we're continually amazed by the nonprofit sector's innovative spirit and dedication to creating positive change in our communities and around the globe," said Rick Buettner, Managing Director of Global Nonprofits at AWS. "Through the Imagine Grant program, we're seeing organizations embrace cloud technology in ways that fundamentally reshape how they deliver on their missions. From scaling their impact to reaching underserved communities, these nonprofits are showing us what's possible when vision meets innovation. We're proud to support their transformative work and help them build solutions that will benefit communities for years to come."
