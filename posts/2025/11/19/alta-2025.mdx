With support from [Arnold Ventures][arnold-ventures] and in partnership with the [Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse][clearinghouse], we completed a six‑month exploratory phase
to test how AI could responsibly improve access to complex court data. During that time, we tested and validated tools that classify legal
documents, summarize dense filings, and enable plain-English search—all using public legal data and open-source infrastructure.

Another project accelerated by this research is our open source citator, which will track how court opinions are treated over time—whether they’re
overruled, followed, or distinguished. It’s still in development, and we’re looking for volunteers to help annotate cases and move this project forward.

This work proves that AI can be developed responsibly—using open models, public data, and transparent methods—to support legal research and advocacy.
A foundation is now laid to develop tools to make civil rights cases easier to find, understand, and analyze.

I was also pleased to join Patrick Palace on the [Legal Talk Network podcast][legal-talk-podcast] to speak about the award and this project.
