<p className="lead">We at Free Law Project are building the first open-source legal Citator powered by AI and we need your help to take it to the next level.</p>

In our [last month's progress report](https://free.law/2025/05/01/Citator/), we showed significant progress in advancing the Citator project forward, and we’re now at a pivotal stage: to systematically evaluate our Citator, we must grow our expert-annotated dataset of citation treatments.

If you’re excited about open-source technology, passionate about advancing access to legal information, and have deep legal expertise—especially in reading and analyzing judicial opinions—we invite you to volunteer for our Citator Expert Annotation Project.

## What’s involved?
As a volunteer, you’ll review citing opinions and identify the treatment (e.g., overruled, reversed, distinguished, etc) applied to each cited opinion. 

The work is flexible: you set your own hours and we’ll assign cases that best align with your expertise.

## Why does it matter?
A good AI model begins with great data. 

Your careful, high-quality annotations will directly shape the accuracy and integrity of the Citator we’re building—one that can serve the legal community for years to come. We expect this to be huge for those using the American legal system, particularly those that might not have access to expensive paid services.

If you're interested in contributing to this open-source effort, please send us at email at rachel@free.law or fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1DBtOGFmhfuPn7BixAvuzlqo7h3Gbb5P8Z9nOTDJD2PU/edit). We’ll be in touch with next steps.

## Let’s build this—together!
