Imagine a world where every American can access the law freely and easily, regardless of income or background. Free Law Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, is turning this vision into reality. We leverage technology, data, and advocacy to make legal information accessible to all, breaking down barriers that have traditionally kept the law out of reach for many.

Since our inception in 2010, Free Law Project has grown into a cornerstone of the legal ecosystem. We now provide a range of innovative services, including CourtListener, the RECAP Suite, and Bots.law. These platforms, alongside our numerous open-source tools for data collection and analysis, empower millions of users—from journalists and academics to everyday Americans.

Free Law Project is more than just a service provider; we are critical infrastructure in the legal ecosystem. Our work is supported by individual donations, private foundation grants, corporate donors, and partnerships with tech startups. Together, we are reshaping the legal landscape to be more open, transparent, and equitable.

## Testimonials
We asked our users to share how they’ve been impacted by Free Law Project. Here are a few testimonials:

_"I teach a course on Race and the Law to college students. CourtListener makes it MUCH easier for them to find relevant court cases without having to use cumbersome, expensive subscription databases. Thank you for making these materials publicly accessible—as they should be."_

_"CourtListener has facilitated the democratization of law, for myself, and no doubt many more."_

_"It is so nice to have a resource that anyone can access, anyone can easily search. The learning curve for seeking out the individual court pages & PACER is steep for people who are new to court content. Your teams & dedication keep us learning, growing & thriving by breaking down barriers to justice for the average person."_

_"I'm a civil rights activist in Montgomery, Alabama and CourtListener helps me access and keep track of important cases."_

_"This year it has helped allow me to track cases challenging the Trump administration…I still use PACER for my own cases (with RECAP turned on, of course), but CourtListener has made it possible to closely follow key filings in cases that have significance beyond the narrow area of...law in which I practice. Thanks!"_

## Where to Next?
Some initiatives we're prioritizing:
- Creation of an open-source modular citator to help lawyers and researchers verify whether case law remains valid.
- Partnership with courts for a pilot program of an open-source eFiling and open docketing system that will support self-represented litigants.
- Assist reporters through the development of open-source tools and help with research for story leads.
- Expand our database of judicial conflicts to state court judges.
- Upgrade and expand the functionality of the RECAP browser extension used by tens of thousands of people.
- Continued refinement of our tools, interface, and functionality to ensure that
