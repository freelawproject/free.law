In this engaging conversation, Jessica and Sam highlighted the transformative power of partnerships between courts and
nonprofits. They focused on creating and implementing tools like guided interviews and efiling solutions for
self-represented litigants. Together, using technology, courts and nonprofits can develop and implement legal technology
solutions to address systemic barriers to justice.

### Why This Matters

Millions of people face obstacles to accessing justice due to the high costs of legal representation, complex
procedures, and limited resources. Jessica and Sam emphasized:
<ul>
  <li><u>The scope of the access to justice gap</u>: Courts and legal aid organizations face overwhelming demand,
    leaving many individuals without adequate legal assistance.</li>
  <li><u>Collaborative innovations</u>: From online guided interviews to self-help filing tools, these partnerships
    are breaking down traditional barriers to justice.</li>
  <li><u>Sustainable impact</u>: By working together, courts and nonprofits can design and deploy scalable solutions
    tailored to community needs.</li>
</ul>

### Key Takeaways

<ul>
  <li><u>The power of partnerships</u>: Combining the technical expertise of nonprofits with the procedural knowledge
    of courts creates stronger, more effective solutions.</li>
  <li><u>User-centered design</u>: Tools like guided interviews empower individuals to navigate complex legal systems
    with confidence.</li>
  <li><u>Technology as an equalizer</u>: These innovations are leveraging the playing field for self-represented
    litigants.</li>
