<p className="lead">If you think artificial intelligence is set to change the future of the legal system, it is important to understand that it has already been changing the legal landscape for years.</p>

Recently, our Case Law Lead, William Palin, presented a five-minute "LIT Bit" on this topic. At Suffolk Law School's [Legal Innovation and Technology Conference][2] (LITCon24) he shared with the audience of 200 about how we use AI to advance legal tech.

His talk covered the intersection of open data and AI at Free Law Project, including the ways we've built up data sets, how they're being used by others, and where we see them going in the future.

Colin MacArthur, User Researcher for eFiling, was part of a panel addressing e-filing and building public infrastructure. The panel was moderated by Sam Glover, Suffolk LIT Lab, and they were joined by Sara Hoskinson, Kansas Judicial Branch, Lisa Colpoys Filing Fairness Project, and Bryce Wiley, full stack software developer. 

The panel addressed current issues and challenges with e-filing systems and some paths forward to improve the process and addressed the need for systems that focus on self-represented litigants.
