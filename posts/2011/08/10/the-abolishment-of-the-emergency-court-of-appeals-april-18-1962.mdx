One of the coming features at [CourtListener](http://courtlistener.com)
is an API for the law. Part of that feature is going to be some basic
information about the courts themselves, so I spent some time over the
weekend researching courts that served a special purpose but were since
abolished.

One such court was the [Emergency Court of
Appeals](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Emergency_Court_of_Appeals).
It was created during World War II to set prices, and, naturally, was
the court of appeals for many cases. The creation date of the court is
prominently published in various places on the Internet, but the
abolishment history of the court was very difficult to find. After
researching online for some time, and learning that my library card had
expired (sigh), I put in a query with the [Library of
Congress](http://www.loc.gov), which provides free research of these
types of things.

Within a couple days, the provided me with this amazing response, which
I'm sharing here, and on the above Wikipedia article:

Pretty fantastic research. And for free! Thanks LOC.
