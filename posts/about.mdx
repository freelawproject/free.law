<p class="lead">Started in 2010, Free Law Project is the leading 501﻿(c)﻿(3) nonprofit using technology, data, and advocacy to make the legal ecosystem more equitable and competitive.</p>

We do this by:

 - Curating and providing free, public, and permanent access to primary legal materials
 - Developing technology useful for legal research and innovation
 - Fostering and supporting an open ecosystem for legal research
 - Supporting academic research in the legal sector

A number of major projects exemplify this approach:

 - [The RECAP Suite][recap] &mdash; A collection of tools to open up federal court data.
 
 - [CourtListener.com][cl] &mdash; Our fully-searchable and accessible archive of court data including growing repositories of opinions, oral arguments, judges, judicial financial records, and federal filings.

 - [Bots.law][bots] &mdash; A collection of bots that help attorneys, journalists and the public keep up with court cases.

We also use advocacy to make change on the policy level, with major successes putting oral argument audio online, creating a new government database of judicial financial disclosures, building the momentum to bring FOIA to the judicial branch, and more.

Taken together, this work provides valuable tools and analysis for those that want to access, study, or improve the American legal system.
