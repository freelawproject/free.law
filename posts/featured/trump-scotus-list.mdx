On June 27, 2018, Associate Justice Kennedy informed President Trump that he would be retiring from the Supreme Court effective July 31st. In response to this announcement, President Trump stated that his next Supreme Court nomination would come from [his existing list][list] of potential Supreme Court justices.

In our [Judge and Appointment database][db], we have compiled extensive information about American judges, including their biographical data, the roles they have held before, during and after their time in the judicial branch, their political affiliations, and their campaign finance information (if applicable). The judges are also linked to the opinions they have authored. 

Below are links to every judge in our database that is on President Trump's list. For a few judges, we have not yet completed this work, and so there's no link.
