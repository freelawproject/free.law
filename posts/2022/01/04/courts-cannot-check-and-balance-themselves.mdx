<p class="lead">Over the weekend, Chief Justice Roberts published <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/2021year-endreport.pdf">his annual report</a> discussing the important happenings in the federal judiciary.</p>

His general thesis, as [discussed][wsj] in [great detail][nyt] by [others][ftc], is that the courts regulate themselves just fine. As the director of Free Law Project, an organization that works to improve the judiciary, I couldn't disagree more. The depth and duration of the problems uncovered at the judiciary prove that no organization can regulate itself.

But setting that aside — and yes, it's a lot to set aside — I wanted to focus on some errors in his report that deeply weaken his argument.

Free Law Project has worked hard for several years to build our [database of judicial financial disclosures][fddb] that the Wall Street Journal used for their investigation, and, to put it mildly, Roberts report omits a few important pieces of context.

First, Roberts says in his report that the WSJ uncovered 685 instances of ethics violations and notes that that represents "99.97% compliance." A few things here:

1. The tally is now up to nearly 1,000 ethics violations. You can't pooh-pooh that kind of number. That's nearly 1,000 instances where parties in a case might reasonably worry about a judge's impartiality.

2. Even this number is a vast undercount, for several reasons.

    - Because it is based on case names, this count only includes those parties that are listed in the name of the case itself. If the media were granted an exception to the PACER fee schedule, the WSJ might have been able to obtain full party lists and would have identified innumerable additional conflicts.

        Alas, [the PACER fee schedule][fees] bars media from free access to federal court materials. (I've never heard any explanation why members of the media cannot receive PACER fee waivers.)

    - The WSJ's work didn't analyze magistrate judges, bankruptcy judges or judiciary staff members.

    - Our transaction database is only complete through 2018. We have some information from 2019, but are lacking about a third of it. We don't have transaction information from 2020 or 2021 either.

    - Finally, because the judiciary released most of this information in terrible image-based files, we had to use OCR to build our database. This introduces typos into the investment information in our system and makes it much more difficult to find conflicts.

It's a fair bet that there are thousands more ethical violations that remain unknown both to the public and the judiciary.

Second, Roberts has a doozy in his report. He writes:

> the Journal did not report that any [conflicts] affected the judge's consideration of a case or that the judge’s actions…actually financially benefited the judge

Yikes. Robert's surely knows it's nearly impossible to prove that a ruling affected a judge's consideration of a case or that a judge benefited financially. For one thing, that's not the point. Appearances matter too, but even setting that aside, the Wall Street Journal *did* in fact demonstrate quite a lot of this kind of thing. Here's a [quote to that effect from the WSJ's reporting][wsj2]:

> When judges participated in such [conflicted] cases, about two-thirds of rulings on motions that were contested came down in favor of their or their family’s financial interests.

Well, that looks bad, and that *is* the point. It's unlikely anybody will *prove* that a judge's conflict altered their consideration of a case.

But when over a hundred federal judges violate an ethics law nearly a thousand times over the course of a decade without the judiciary even noticing? It takes some gall to read about that on the cover of the Wall Street Journal, to watch Congress hold a devastating hearing on the topic, and to turn around and reiterate your need of complete independence.

The judiciary is *not* doing just fine regulating itself. It's only through the dogged work of Free Law Project and the Wall Street Journal that the judiciary is even learning about this problem at all. Left to its own devices, these violations would still be happening without any check at all.

Finally, though I could go on debunking his arguments and responding to other parts of his letter, I'll just close with one last comment. The changes proposed by lawmakers — and which we strongly support — are mild. The [bill][b] largely just puts financial disclosures online. It could call for an end to stock investments by judges. It could add sanctions or fines for judges that violate the ethics law (there are currently none). It doesn't do either.

Roberts should be glad he's receiving the deference from Congress that he is.
