<p className="lead">
  We have collected over <a href="/projects/judge-pics/">1,000 portraits of judges</a> and over <a href="/projects/seal-rookery/">250 court seals</a>. We have always made these available as raw data, but today we are excited to announce two new services that make using these pictures easier than ever.
</p>

In the past, we provided these images as a large Python package. To use it, you had to install the package and then connect your webserver up with it. This was terribly cumbersome — particularly as we added more and more photos — and we hated doing it even in our own systems, where we use both judge portraits and court seals.

To fix this, we're releasing a new version of the Python library. This version will no longer ship the photos themselves and will instead only contain metadata about the photos. In tandem with the new Python package, we're launching a new free service that hosts the photos on your behalf.

Now, instead of having to host the images on your server, you simply look up the judge or seal that you want, and we give you a hosted link of that photo that you can embed in your website or application.

For example, here's how you'd find Justice Ketanji Jackson's photo:

```txt
>>> from judge_pics.search import portrait, ImageSizes
>>> portrait("ketanji jackson", ImageSizes.SMALL)
'https://portraits.free.law/v2/128/jackson-ketanji-1970.jpeg'
```

Or, if you know the CourtListener ID for the judge, you can do:

```txt
>>> from judge_pics.search import portrait, ImageSizes
>>> portrait(1609, ImageSizes.SMALL)  # <-- Justice Jackson is number 1609
'https://portraits.free.law/v2/128/jackson-ketanji-1970.jpeg'
```

Finally, if you want to just see a judge's picture, you can use `show()` like this:

<CaptionedImage imgProps={{
  "src": "/images/judges/climage-jackson.png",
  "alt": "A screenshot of the Python shell. In the shell the show() function was imported from judge_pics.search. Then, the command print(show(1609, ImageSizes.SMALL) was run. The output of that command is an extremely low resolution but colorful representation of the judge that no blind person would find the least bit useful. Sorry."
}} height="h-16" width="w-16">A pixelated picture of Judge Jackson rendered as ANSI escape codes</CaptionedImage>

It works the same for seals too, but you import from the `seal_rookery` instead of from `judge_pics`, and instead of getting links at `portraits.free.law`, you get them at `seals.free.law`. Simple.

As of a few days ago, we use these services in CourtListener to show pictures of judges in our judge database and to add nice album art to oral argument audio files.

[Here's an example of Justice Jackson](https://www.courtlistener.com/person/1609/ketanji-brown-jackson/). Use `View Source` to get an idea of how it works.
