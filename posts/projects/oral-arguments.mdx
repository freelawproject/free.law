title: Oral Argument Recording Archive

<p className="lead">Launched in 2014, our archive of oral argument recordings is the largest open collection of legal audio on the Internet.</p>

This collection was created when we learned that federal circuit courts were deleting oral argument recordings from their websites due to lack of space. At the time, nobody was collecting this information, and it was going down a digital black hole.

Federal circuit court oral arguments are historical documents that should not be deleted from the Internet. That's why in addition to collecting these files and saving them in our database, we also [upload them to the Internet Archive][ia].

We also use AI to generate transcripts for all federal circuit court arguments just minutes after the audio is released by the courts, allowing users to search and set alerts for anything said in court including statutes, citations, and keywords.

In addition:

 - [We make every oral argument fully searchable][audio].

 - [We make podcasts for every court and allow you to make custom podcasts][pods].

 - We convert each audio file to an MP3, and we add good metadata and album art to the file.

 - We support [alerts for oral argument files][alerts].

 - The recordings are [available in our APIs][apis].

Our collection of SCOTUS recordings goes back to 2013. Before that, we recommend the wonderful [Oyez Project][oyez], which has SCOTUS audio going back to 1955.

This work has been possible in part thanks to a grant from Columbia University Library. If you find this work valuable, [please consider making a donation][donate] so that it may continue to thrive.
