<p className="lead">Eyecite is a high performance, robust, open source tool for extracting legal citations from text.</p>

It has been tested against more than fifty million citations, and is used, among other things, to annotate millions of legal documents in the collections of <Link href="/projects/courtlistener/"><a>CourtListener</a></Link> and the <a href="https://case.law">Caselaw Access Project</a>.

Eyecite was developed in collaboration with the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a>.

Eyecite recognizes a wide variety of citations commonly appearing in American legal decisions, including:

Type | Example

**Full** | Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98, 99-100 (2000)
**Short** | 531 U.S., at 99
**Statutory** | Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 1, § 2
**Law Journal** | 1 Minn. L. Rev. 1
