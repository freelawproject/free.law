<p className="lead">Our Reporters Database is a Python library or JSON file that provides structured information about nearly every American legal reporter.</p>

The database can be used in a variety of tools. For example, we use the Reporters Database to [extract citations from text][e], and to look them up in our database.

In the Reporters Database, you will find information about nearly 1,000 different reporters dating from 1754 to today. For each reporter, we have researched and provide structured information such as the date it began and ended, its official abbreviation, and any other variations that we've found while parsing over fifty million legal citations.

We believe that with the exception of niche, small, regional reporters, this database is complete and ready for production.

The Reporters Database is written in Python, but is available as JSON or can easily be extended to other languages.
