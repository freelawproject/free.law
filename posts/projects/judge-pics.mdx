<p className="lead">Our database of judicial portraits is an open collection of meticulously cropped, edited, and organized photos of judges that can be dropped into websites or other applications.</p>

With over 1,000 portraits of state and federal judges, this collection adds a visual element to many applications that straight data lacks.

As of version 2.0, we provide these photos via a free scalable service. This saves you the trouble of hosting or maintaining the photos yourself. Of course, if you prefer to build your own system, the raw data is available in our git repository.

This project has been supported by NSF Grant SES-1260875 and Pre/Dicta.
