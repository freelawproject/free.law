[CourtListener][cl], our flagship project, is a fully-searchable and accessible archive of court data, including growing repositories of opinions, oral arguments, judges and judicial financial records, and federal filings.

On a good day, CourtListener gets tens of thousands of new items, sends tens of thousands of alerts to users monitoring cases or search terms, and serves over a million people.

Some of the research and monitoring tools in CourtListener include:

- The [RECAP Archive][cl-recap] of PACER data, consisting of nearly every federal case, hundreds of millions of docket entries, and tens of millions of legal documents
- Even more tools for accessing PACER in the [RECAP Suite][recap]
- Over 10 million [opinions][op] across hundreds of jurisdictions
- A database of thousands of state and federal [judges][cl-jdb]
- The largest database of judicial [financial disclosures][cl-fd]
- The biggest collection of [oral arguments][cl-oa] online
- [Alerts][alerts] to monitor mentions of topics, people, companies, citations, and more

CourtListener is built on [open source technology][ost].

Finally, for developers, CourtListener hosts scalable [APIs and database replication][api]. These powerful tools help journalists, researchers, and organizations access our data to build the next generation of technology.
