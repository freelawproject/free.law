<p className="lead">The Judicial Seals Repository is a small project to collect and organize all of the court seals in use in the United States. At present, it has approximately 250 seals.</p>

This project can be useful if you need to display or look up the seal of a court. For example, at right you can see the seal of the Supreme Court.

As of version 2.0, we provide these photos via a free scalable service. This saves you the trouble of hosting or maintaining the photos yourself. Of course, if you prefer to build your own system, the raw data is available in our git repository.

To learn more about these seals, see their page on the Python Package Index (PyPi) or on Github.
