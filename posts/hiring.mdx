## Product Manager (Full Time / Remote, Closed)

<p className="lead">We also welcome <b>senior user experience researchers and designers</b> excited to lead a product’s development from research to operation to apply for this position.</p>

**Compensation:** $90,000-$110,000

We are hiring a Product Manager to shape and build the first open electronic filing and case management systems for courts.

For years, courts have used closed, proprietary filing systems that stymie the public’s access to justice and right to judicial transparency. Such systems serve nobody well. They erect paywalls between the public and the courts while poorly serving the needs of court staff. To combat this and finally break this anti-democratic pattern, we are developing and launching open systems that better serve the public and the courts.

Building on [our initial research in this space][initial-report], we are hiring a UX-savvy product manager. In this role, the successful candidate will build partnerships with courts and the public and work to understand their needs. They will conduct user research with courts through discovery interviews, contextual inquiry, or other methods deemed appropriate by the successful candidate. They will then envision products or services that could solve court problems, help court users, and be financially viable. As they work, they will publish their findings via our website as a series of blog posts or formal reference papers.

After a discovery and definition process, the successful candidate will shift their work to system design, using approaches such as paper prototypes, low-res prototypes, and wireframes. At this stage, the candidate will team up with developers to create a prototype of the system, iteratively refining the prototype based on continuous user research.

In addition, the person in this role may be called upon to help guide the design of our existing systems, CourtListener.com, Bots.law, and RECAP.

They will work closely with the Executive Director and Advisory Committee to ensure that the project is on track. They will also work with the Director of Philanthropy on reporting to funders and identifying additional sources of funding.

This role will involve travel to the courts we are partnering with, though we do not envision that travel happening on weekends or particularly frequently, unless desired by the candidate.

The top priorities of this position are to:
 - Manage and execute all aspects of the development of the project
 - Deepen relationships with existing court partners, and open new fruitful relationships that advance the project's goals
 - Conduct user research to understand needs, motivations, behaviors, and pain points. Communicate findings and insights within FLP and to courts, advocacy organizations and other partners
 - Identify new services, systems or products that would help solve user problems, but are feasible within a complex technical ecosystem
 - Create wireframes, prototypes, user flows, and mock-ups that effectively demonstrate ideas for new services
 - Develop materials and presentations that demonstrate the as-is and possible future state of these services. Speak about this project at conferences and webinars.

### Experience, Skills & Knowledge
The ideal candidate will have the right experience and skills to:
 - Lead a product from discovery to concept to MVP
 - Set and execute their own plan of work independently, but also actively share and shape it with others
 - Learn and understand data technologies and standards that courts use to store and exchange case information
 - Plan, conduct, analyze and report common qualitative user experience research methods, like interviews, contextual inquiry, and so on.
 - Explain and justify user-centered research and product management methods to audiences with varying experience with both
 - Create a research-driven product vision, particularly for diverse potential customers in varied environments
 - Develop creative mission-aligned sustainability models that meet user needs
 - Support our mission of transparency, by publicly sharing not just the results of work, but intermediate steps
 - Present effectively, write compellingly and facilitate effective meetings and workshops
 - Communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical partners
 - Work within the Agile project management system


### Preferred Qualifications
 - Bachelor’s degree, advanced degree, or equivalent lived experience
 - JD or experience working in the legal system or legal tech is helpful
 - Experience coding is a bonus, not a requirement. We use Django.


### Benefits
 - The base salary range for this US-based, full-time, remote, and exempt position is $90,000 - $110,000, not including variable compensation
 - This is a benefits-eligible position. Free Law Project offers paid time-off, company paid holidays, SIMPLE IRA retirement program with a company elected match, and assistance with health insurance premiums
 - Free Law Project is an equal opportunity employer. The Company offers employment opportunities to all applicants and employees without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, medical condition, marital status, veteran status, citizenship, genetic information, hairstyles, or any other status protected by local or federal law.

## Paid Summer Internship (Closed)

Every year, judges must file financial disclosure reports listing their investments and potential conflicts. For the past several years, we have worked with the federal government to collect these reports, and we now have a groundbreaking collection of thousands of reports that spans nearly a decade.

We also have a huge collection of judge profiles in our database. The task of our summer intern will be to combine these two collections of data so that judges, their financial disclosures, and their courtroom work are all in one big, transparent database.

To do this, the developer will need to:

1. Convert the financial disclosure reports from TIFF files to PDF.

1. Write a script to merge the new PDFs with the database.

1. Update our website to expose this new resource.

1. Write a blog post advertising the new tool to journalists, lawyers, and the public.

Our stack is Django, Postgresql, and Bootstrap.

The successful applicant will be paired with our lead developer, who will provide technical and process mentorship through the summer.

If you think you may be able to help us create this system, please submit your application as described above. Applications will be accepted until May 29th, and the internship will run until the end of August or your school's start date, if sooner.

Thank you!

## Open Data Backend Developer (Closed)

For this contract position, we are looking for somebody to help us with two major initiatives that we expect to take around six months to complete.

The first initiative will be to gather and share a huge new collection of legal data that previously was only available behind a paywall. If successful, this project will collect millions of documents and make them freely available to the public.

The second initiative is to finally audit and complete our case law database. For the first time in history, thanks to the tireless work of innumerable people, a free, audited, and complete collection of case law is possible. We have been working with librarians for years to gather the data needed for this project, have gotten the work funded, and now just need the right person to make it happen. Like Wikipedia, once this is done, it'll never need to be done again.

If these projects are successful, we hope to hire you as a full time employee.

We're looking for somebody that has deep experience in the following:

 - Languages: Python, SQL

 - Database: Modeling, PostgreSQL

 - APIs: Django REST Framework, Django ORM & migrations

Excellent written communication and a demonstrated ability to work independently on larger technical projects are also important for this role.


Proficiency with the following is preferred, though expertise is not a must:

 - Celery distributed task queues including task canvases

 - Django framework

 - An understanding of the American legal system, with a particular expertise in its data and information flows


The following are nice-to-haves:

 - Scraping: lxml, XPath, Python requests, HTTP

 - Knowledge of the Github workflow and expertise with git

 - Experience working with open source code and in open-culture organizations

 - Experience or interest in developing extensions for Chrome or Firefox

 - A degree from a law school, school of information, or school of library science (or similar experience)

 - A gnawing frustration with the current legal ecosystem
