# Closed Positions

## Paid Summer Internship (Closed)

Every year, judges must file financial disclosure reports listing their investments and potential conflicts. For the past several years, we have worked with the federal government to collect these reports, and we now have a groundbreaking collection of thousands of reports that spans nearly a decade. 

We also have a huge collection of judge profiles in our database. The task of our summer intern will be to combine these two collections of data so that judges, their financial disclosures, and their courtroom work are all in one big, transparent database.

To do this, the developer will need to:

1. Convert the financial disclosure reports from TIFF files to PDF.

1. Write a script to merge the new PDFs with the database.

1. Update our website to expose this new resource.

1. Write a blog post advertising the new tool to journalists, lawyers, and the public. 

Our stack is Django, Postgresql, and Bootstrap. 

The successful applicant will be paired with our lead developer, who will provide technical and process mentorship through the summer. 

If you think you may be able to help us create this system, please submit your application as described above. Applications will be accepted until May 29th, and the internship will run until the end of August or your school's start date, if sooner.

Thank you!


## RECAP Developer (Temp/Contract, Closed)

For this contract position, we are seeking an experienced JavaScript and Extension developer to add several distinct features to our RECAP Extensions for Chrome and Firefox. These extensions are used by tens of thousands of people, including journalists, lawyers, and researchers.

The general purpose of the RECAP Extension is to upload content from the PACER electronic court record system to our servers. Normally PDFs, Zips and HTML in the PACER system cost money to download, so our extension builds a mirror of this data to save people money.

1. Add support to the RECAP extension for [uploading PDFs and HTML from appellate courts][app] on PACER. 

Payments for each of the above tasks will be made according to agreed upon amounts and milestones.

A successful candidate for this position will have experience with the following:

## Open Data Backend Developer (Closed)

For this contract position, we are looking for somebody to help us with two major initiatives that we expect to take around six months to complete. 

The first initiative will be to gather and share a huge new collection of legal data that previously was only available behind a paywall. If successful, this project will collect millions of documents and make them freely available to the public.

The second initiative is to finally audit and complete our case law database. For the first time in history, thanks to the tireless work of innumerable people, a free, audited, and complete collection of case law is possible. We have been working with librarians for years to gather the data needed for this project, have gotten the work funded, and now just need the right person to make it happen. Like Wikipedia, once this is done, it'll never need to be done again.

If these projects are successful, we hope to hire you as a full time employee.
 
We're looking for somebody that has deep experience in the following:

 - Languages: Python, SQL
 
 - Database: Modeling, PostgreSQL
  
 - APIs: Django REST Framework, Django ORM & migrations
 
Excellent written communication and a demonstrated ability to work independently on larger technical projects are also important for this role.
 

Proficiency with the following is preferred, though expertise is not a must:

 - Celery distributed task queues including task canvases
 
 - Django framework
 
 - An understanding of the American legal system, with a particular expertise in its data and information flows
 

The following are nice-to-haves:

 - Scraping: lxml, XPath, Python requests, HTTP

 - Knowledge of the Github workflow and expertise with git
 
 - Experience working with open source code and in open-culture organizations
 
 - Experience or interest in developing extensions for Chrome or Firefox
 
 - A degree from a law school, school of information, or school of library science (or similar experience)
 
 - A gnawing frustration with the current legal ecosystem
 
If you think you may be able to help us launch this system, please submit your application above.

Thank you!
