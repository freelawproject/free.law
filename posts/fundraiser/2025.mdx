## 2025: A Year of Revolutionary Change

This year stands out as one of the most transformative in Free Law Project's history. We didn't just grow as a team and organization—we fundamentally expanded our impact. And we didn't just maintain our mission—we accelerated it.

### Revolutionary New Tools

This year, we launched tools that fundamentally change how people interact with legal information:


1. **Semantic Search**

    In November, [we launched](/2025/11/05/semantic-search-api/) our semantic search API, allowing researchers to find relevant case law based on meaning, not just keywords. This AI-powered tool understands legal concepts and finds cases that matter. It's open-source, open model, and open weights, and it's available via API. Next year we will integrate it directly into CourtListener.

1. **Case Law Redesign**

    We completely [rebuilt](/2025/03/21/case-law-redesign/) how opinions appear on CourtListener. The new design is cleaner, faster, and makes it easier to read and research case law. Every citation is now clickable, making legal research more efficient than ever.

1. **Oral Arguments at Scale**

    We [transcribed](/2025/07/31/oral-argument-transcripts/) over three million minutes of oral argument audio and made it searchable and alertable for the first time. Researchers can now search within transcripts and get alerts when things are said in circuit courts.


### Awards and Recognition

The legal and tech communities recognized our work with major awards this year:

- **[AWS Imagine Grant](/2025/12/03/aws-imagine-grant-winner/)** — Amazon Web Services awarded us a $150,000 grant to support our Justice Initiatives division and the development of a new portal for self-represented litigants.

- **[American Legal Technology Award](/2025/11/19/alta-2025/)** — Free Law Project was named the winner in the Artificial Intelligence category for the careful approach to AI we took in partnership with the [Civil Litigation Clearinghouse](https://clearinghouse.net/) at University of Michigan. This work was supported by Arnold Ventures.
 
- **[Paul H. Chapman Award](/2025/09/10/06/foundation-for-improvement-of-justice-award/)** — As director of Free Law Project, I was honored to receive this award from the Foundation for Improvement of Justice for my contributions to the legal system.


### New Initiatives

We launched major new programs this year that expand our mission:

1. **Justice Initiatives Division** 

    We [created a new division focused on justice reform and litigant support](/2025/12/01/justice-initiatives-division/). This expansion recognizes that technology alone isn't enough—we must also work directly with courts and litigants to improve legal outcomes. This division is currently working on a portal to help self-represented litigants navigate the court system, and solutions for public defenders.

1. **Justice Partner Circle**

    We [launched a new giving program for law firms](/2025/09/30/justice-partners-circle/) that want to make an impact. Justice Partners shape the future of legal practice, support the creation of open legal information, and are leaders that are committed to transparency, accountability, and the public good.

1. **AI Citator**

    We [launched an ambitious project to create an AI Citator](/2025/05/01/citator/) to label case law that is not safe to use. To make this a world-class tool, we are [working with more than 80 volunteers](/2025/09/30/citator-annotation-updates/) to build a benchmark for this tool. This collaborative effort brings together law librarians, practicing lawyers, and court clerks to verify and enhance our citation graph. 

    When complete, this project will provide a free and open alternative to expensive commercial citators. At last, an open citator will be freely available to all.

1. **Case Law Scanning**

    The only way to have a complete record of case law is to scan the books. This will ensure that our database of case law is current and complete and we'll have much more to say about this in 2026, as this project ramps up.

### Advocacy and Impact

We continued our advocacy work to protect access to justice:

**A Friend of the Court** — With other legal innovators, [we filed an amicus brief](/2025/10/02/tr-v-ross-amicus/) in *[Thomson Reuters v. ROSS](https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70622297/thomson-reuters-enterprise-centre-gmbh-v-ross-intelligence-inc/)*, a landmark case about copyright and legal research. Our brief argued that legal data must remain accessible and that restrictive copyright claims threaten the open courts principle. The case has major implications for the future of legal research. We were proud to lead this effort.

**Presentations** — We worked hard this year to get our message out and to advocate for a better legal system. We spoke on [two][pc1] [podcasts][pc2], many [classes][class] at law and journalism schools, and [gave][ilta] [six][calicon1] [talks][calicon2] [at][litcon1] [legal][litcon2] [conferences][lsc].

**Transparency Advocacy** — Throughout the year, we advocated for court transparency, including speaking out when courts restricted access to records, fighting to keep legal research private, and pushing for greater PACER access. We continue to be a voice for open courts and accessible justice.

**Powering News and Awareness** — The biggest newsrooms in American now use our APIs and data to power [investigative][nyt] [pieces][wapo] and [legal dashboards][nyt-dash]. We also are a driving force behind [numerous][lawfare] [legal][statesunited] [trackers][js] that help people understand changes to the law.

### Infrastructure and Scaling

This year we served over 800 million pages and PDFs and had over 1,000 people use our APIs. Scaling to this level of traffic and attention has been difficult and expensive, and we've spent considerable time shoring up our systems. We see no sign of this slowing down and are targeting a billion downloads in 2026.


### Community Engagement

We stayed connected with our community through regular updates and engagement:

- **465 Bluesky Posts** — We kept our community informed with nearly daily updates about new features, policy developments, and legal tech news. 

    [Follow us @free.law](https://bsky.app/profile/free.law) for the latest updates.

- **Reddit** — To reach new audiences, we [created a new subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/freelawproject/), where we discuss the internals of our work. 

- **Open Source Contributions** — Nearly all of our work continues to be open source so that others can build on the work we do. This year we had an unprecedented level of volunteer engagement, and we were proud to release [a new open source tool to make our web framework, Django, more scalable][s3].

## Looking Forward

2026 is going to be busy: 

- **Litigant Portal Launch and Expansion** — We'll expand our litigant tool to more jurisdictions and case types.

- **Tools for Public Defenders** — We've begun working with public defenders to identify their needs and challenges. In 2026, we'll begin building the tools they need.  

- **Case Law** — We'll ramp up our scanning project, launch an enhanced viewing experience on CourtListener, and provide an unimpeachable case law database.

- **Citator** — We'll complete and launch our AI-powered citator, providing a free alternative to expensive commercial tools.

- **State and SCOTUS Filings** — The RECAP Archive has almost half a billion federal records. In 2026, we'll begin adding records from state courts and SCOTUS.

- **A New Website** — CourtListener needs a more modern design, and in 2026 we'll deliver a new, faster, more accessible, and more modern version of the site.

- **Search Enhancements** — We'll continue improving search with better relevancy and smarter features.

- **Advocacy** — We'll continue fighting for open courts and accessible justice, filing amicus briefs where needed and speaking out when access is threatened.
