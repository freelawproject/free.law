## FLP's Year in Review

2021 has been a momentous year for Free Law Project. The highlight of the year came in September and October, when our work supported a series of front-page articles in the Wall Street Journal. These articles exposed over 100 judges with financial conflicts that had failed to recuse from over 600 cases. We submitted [written testimony to Congress][testimony] and expect Congress to soon pass [a bill][ethics] to prevent such failings in the future (the House is voting this week!).

In the PACER world, the [bill to make PACER free][oca] is finally gaining momentum again, after [we labeled PACER a national security concern][pacer-sec]. We expect updates on this very soon. We are also continuing our crusade to add recent filing feeds to every federal court. We'll be sending a letter about this to about 50 courts early next year.

A new project we're working on is [a tool][xray] to find badly-made redactions in PDF documents. Soon, we will run it across millions of legal filings so that we can identify which organizations are failing to redact information. This will be another blockbuster report, when we reveal dire redaction failures in numerous federal filings.

We will spend time next year promoting this tool so that bad redactions will become a thing of the past.

In addition to our advocacy work, we have continued expanding and supporting RECAP and CourtListener.

In 2021, we:

 - Added a [new tagging feature][tagging] to dockets so that cases can be tagged and shared
 - Launched a new [legal citation extractor][eye] that finds nearly any legal citation
 - Greatly expanded our collection of opinions in several states

Behind the scenes, we were proud to:

 - Rebuild [our homepage][home] so that it finally shows what we're all about
 - Receive [a PAGI award][pagi] from the American Association of Law Librarians
 - Add several new security protections to CourtListener that can rapidly detect and deter hackers
 - Transition to storage.courtlistener.com so viral documents can be downloaded by millions of people without a hitch
 - Move our servers to [a more reliable provider][lmi]
 - Identify and report [a security bug][python] in the Python programming language (this makes the Internet itself more secure)

We've been growing and it's been busy!

## Looking Forward to 2022

Next year is going to be a very big one. As always, we plan to expand on our current projects while starting a few new ones.

We plan to:

 - Continue pushing for feeds of new filings in all federal courts
 - Pass [the bill][ethics] to tamp down judicial conflicts
 - Pass [the bill][oca] to make PACER free
 - [Continue pushing][foia] for a FOIA-like bill for the judicial branch
 - Increase awareness of [problematic redactions][xray]
 - Vastly expand our collection of opinions so it is one of the best online
 - Finally add appellate support to the RECAP extension

And of course, we'll continue supporting our thousands of users of CourtListener.com and the RECAP Extensions.
