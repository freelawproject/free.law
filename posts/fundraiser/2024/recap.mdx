<SimpleDisclosure buttonText={"Where did this tab come from?"}>
  <p>You use the RECAP extension. RECAP is maintained by Free Law Project, a small non-profit that works to improve the American judicial system.</p>
  <p>Maintaining RECAP is difficult and expensive and we sometimes pop open a tab like this to ask for your support.</p>
  <p>If RECAP has saved you time or money or if you believe in the work we do, we hope you will support us.</p>
  <p>Sorry to interrupt you.</p>

<p className="lead">The RECAP extension you have installed is maintained by Free Law Project, a non-profit that works to improve the justice system. This is our website. Once each year we ask for donations so we can continue hosting and enhancing RECAP.</p>
<p className="lead">The more support you give, the more we are able to do.</p>

We need your support to continue enhancing and maintaining the RECAP system. If RECAP has saved you money or if you believe in what we do, please help us with a tax-deductible donation today.
