Free Law Project:

 - Sponsors the [RECAP Suite][recap], which surfaces thousands of documents from the federal courts each day.

 - Runs [Bots.law][b] to keep the public posted about big and small federal cases as they break.

 - Is building [a collection of every American legal decision][opinions], because if you don't know how the laws are interpreted, you don't know what the laws are.

 - Hosts a [one-of-a-kind database][fds] with more than 250,000 pages of judicial financial records.

 - Hosts [the largest archive of oral argument audio in the world][oa], so you can hear what it's really like in the courthouse.
 
 - Provides [APIs and bulk data][api] to researchers, journalists, and other organizations, spuring and streamlining legal innovation.

 - Maintains [a database of machine-readable information about thousands of judges][judges].

These initiatives have contributed in numerous ways to a more informed citizenry and a more fair justice system. With your support, we will expand these systems and our impact.
